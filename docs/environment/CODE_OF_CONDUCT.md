## Attribution and Evolution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, and enhanced with constitutional intelligence principles specific to the ARCx ecosystem.

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Last Updated**: August 1, 2025  

This document may be updated to reflect the evolving needs of our community while maintaining our core constitutional principles. All changes will be proposed, reviewed, and decided through our transparent governance process.

## Constitutional Intelligence in Practice

This Code of Conduct embodies our belief that healthy communities, like healthy governance systems, require:

- **Transparent Processes**: Open procedures for decision-making and enforcement
- **Accountability Mechanisms**: Consequences for violations and rewards for excellence
- **Continuous Evolution**: Adaptation based on experience and changing needs
- **Inclusive Participation**: Equal voice for all community members

By participating in the ARCx community, you agree to uphold these principles and contribute to building the future of constitutional intelligence in blockchain and AI governance.
