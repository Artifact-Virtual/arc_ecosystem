The year 2025 represents a pivotal
 moment in the evolution of global finance,
 as stablecoins—digital currencies
 designed to maintain stable value—
 emerge from crypto trading tools to
 become critical infrastructure for
 worldwide commerce.
 This comprehensive analysis examines
 how regulatory breakthroughs,
 competitive dynamics, and regional
 adoption patterns are reshaping the
 fundamental architecture of money itself.
 KEY FINDINGS & IMPLICATIONS
 Regulatory Watershed 
The passage of the GENIUS Act by the U.S.
 Senate with a bipartisan 68-30 vote marks
 the first comprehensive federal legislation
 regulating stablecoins, providing
 institutional investors with the regulatory
 clarity needed for large-scale adoption.
 This legislative victory catalyzes a global
 regulatory convergence, with nations
 worldwide developing frameworks ranging
 from comprehensive oversight (U.S.,
 Singapore, Hong Kong) to restrictive
 approaches favoring sovereign digital
 currencies (China, India).
 Market Transformation
 The stablecoin market has achieved
 unprecedented scale, with $625 billion in
 trading volume as of May 2025 and
 projections reaching $1.6-3.7 trillion by
 2030. The competitive landscape features 
a strategic battle between USDC ($61.4
 billion market cap) and USDT ($156 billion
 market cap), while traditional finance
 launches its counteroffensive through
 innovative deposit tokens and strategic
 partnerships like JP Morgan's JPMD and the
 Fiserv-PayPal collaboration.
 Global Laboratory Effect
 Asia leads global stablecoin adoption with
 56% of regional institutions already
 operational—the highest rate worldwide.
 Singapore establishes the regulatory gold
 standard, Hong Kong transforms into a
 crypto-friendly hub, while emerging
 markets from Venezuela to Nigeria utilize
 stablecoins as essential economic
 infrastructure, providing inflation hedges
 and financial inclusion where traditional
 banking fails.
 The analysis reveals three critical
 dynamics reshaping global finance:
 The Silent War – USDC and USDT
 represent competing philosophies—
 regulatory compliance versus market
 accessibility—with outcomes
 determining whether trust or
 momentum prevails in digital currency
 adoption.
 Traditional Finance Responds 
Established institutions are not
 retreating but adapting, creating
 hybrid solutions that combine
 stablecoin efficiency with traditional
 banking protections through deposit
 tokens and interoperable ecosystems.
 Executive
 Summary
 03
Sovereign Response – The emergence
 of Central Bank Digital Currencies
 (CBDCs) in over 130 nations creates a
 parallel development track, raising
 fundamental questions about monetary
 sovereignty in the digital age.
 For institutional investors, the regulatory
 clarity provided by the GENIUS Act
 removes significant barriers to stablecoin
 integration, as evidenced by Circle's 33%
 post-legislation surge and Coinbase's 16%
 increase. The Fiserv-PayPal partnership
 validates stablecoins as core financial
 infrastructure, directly targeting the $150+
 billion cross-border payments market.
 However, significant risks remain,
 including regulatory fragmentation across
 jurisdictions, technical vulnerabilities, and
 systemic concentration among few
 issuers. The collapse of TerraUSD and
 IRON Finance serves as stark reminders of
 inherent risks in algorithmic stablecoin
 designs.
 The stablecoin revolution represents more
 than technological innovation—it
 embodies a fundamental reimagining of
 monetary systems for the digital age.
 Success requires continued collaboration
 between traditional finance, fintech
 innovators, and regulatory authorities,
 with Asian markets providing templates for
 balanced innovation and stability.
 As we approach 2030, the stablecoin
 market's growth trajectory appears
 assured, though its ultimate form—
 whether dominated by private issuers,
 traditional banks, or central bank digital
 currencies—remains uncertain. What is
 clear is that the financial system of the
 future will be increasingly digital, global,
 and dependent on the infrastructure being
 constructed today.
 This analysis provides decision-makers
 across finance, policy, and technology
 sectors with the comprehensive
 framework needed to navigate this
 transformative period and capitalize on
 the opportunities while managing the
 inherent risks of the stablecoin revolution.

 Executive
 Summary
The GENIUS Act
 A Watershed Moment
 The US Stablecoin bill, or the GENIUS Act,
 passing the US Senate vote is a major step
 toward mainstreaming cryptos into
 traditional finance globally. The Guiding
 and Establishing National Innovation for US
 Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the first US
 legislation that regulates cryptocurrencies.
 The bipartisan 68-30 Senate vote
 represents more than legislative victory—it
 signals a fundamental shift in political risk
 assessment. For institutional investors who
 have remained on the sidelines due to
 regulatory uncertainty, this legislation
 provides the clarity needed to justify large
scale stablecoin integration. The bill's
 passage despite Republican-Democratic
 divisions on Trump's crypto conflicts
 demonstrates that stablecoin adoption has
 transcended partisan politics to become
 an economic imperative.
 If signed into law, it would offer more
 clarity and confidence around the use of
 stablecoins, potentially encouraging wider
 adoption and industry growth. Despite
 Republicans obstructing Democratic
 attempts to prohibit Trump from benefiting
 from his several crypto projects while in 
Global Regulatory Landscape
 A Comparative Framework
 The GENIUS Act's passage catalyzes
 regulatory developments worldwide,
 creating a competitive dynamic between
 jurisdictions seeking to attract stablecoin
 innovation while maintaining financial
 stability. Our analysis identifies three
 distinct regulatory approaches emerging
 globally:
 There is a notable interest in emerging
 markets. The IMF reports that
 approximately 60% of central banks in low
and middle-income nations identify
 financial inclusion as a primary motivation
 for their initiatives. In a world where cash is
 losing its relevance, the emergence of
 CBDCs presents a significant

office, the 68-30 vote on Tuesday night
 was an unusual instance of bipartisanship
 in the severely divided Senate.
 The stablecoin vote finally provided the
 crypto industry with the expected returns
 after years of waiting. They spent hundreds
 of millions of dollars electing a crypto
friendly Congress. The crypto giants intend
 to use the most well-funded coalition of
 corporate PACs in US history to saturate
 last year's election and do the same in the
 2026 midterms.

 creates both opportunities and challenges.
 While businesses can forum-shop for
 favorable jurisdictions, the lack of
 international coordination increases
 operational complexity and systemic risk.
 The emergence of "regulatory arbitrage"
 may lead to a race to the bottom or,
 conversely, drive innovation toward more
 robust compliance frameworks.
 The majority of nations are still in the
 experimental stages. The design and
 governance frameworks of CBDCs
 fundamentally determine their impact on
 inclusion gaps and their potential to
 reinforce existing power dynamics.
 The regulatory fragmentation present
 Optimism notwithstanding, there are still
 obstacles to overcome, including a
 patchwork regulatory landscape,
 inadequate know-your-customer rules, and
 the risk of a proliferation of competing
 stablecoins that would add unnecessary
 complexity and slow adoption.
 06
 Regulatory Framework Comparison
 
Trump's executive order preventing CBDC
 development while promoting private
 stablecoins creates a unique policy
 environment. This decision to reject a US
 CBDC hinges less on technological factors
 and more on the dynamics of authority: In
 a digital economy, who controls the
 money? The administration's approach
 favors private innovation over
 government-controlled digital currency,
 potentially accelerating stablecoin
 adoption while raising questions about
 monetary policy effectiveness.
 Elizabeth Warren, the leading figure on
 Senate Banking, stated that the legislation
 would "enhance the worth of Donald
 Trump's corruption." On the other hand,
 Trump, in a post on Truth Social, urged
 House members to pass the key bill
 "lightning fast" and said, "Get it to my desk
 ASAP" so he can sign it into law.
 07
 Trump Administration Impact
 Analysis
 Multiple attempts to modify the legislation
 on the Senate floor were unsuccessful,
 including proposals aimed at Trump, 
enhancing credit card competition,
 bolstering consumer protections, and
 addressing the potential for future
 government bailouts of stablecoins, which
 would lack federal deposit insurance
 coverage.
 Multiple reports have shown Trump and his
 family's wealth has more than doubled in a
 year, with much of the money being made
 from crypto holdings, a sector over which,
 as president, he is able to hold
 considerable sway. A Trump-affiliated
 stablecoin already has a $2 billion market
 value.
        USDT Strategic
        Advantages

 USDC vs. USDT
 More Than Market Share 
Within stablecoins, there is a silent war
 raging: USDC or USDT? Wars in
 technology, such as Apple vs. Android or
 AWS vs. Azure, are all too common. One of
 the most intense and understated debates
 in the cryptocurrency industry is unfolding
 between USDC—created by Circle, and
 USDT—created by Tether.
 Both appear to be nothing more than
 stablecoins tied to the dollar at first look.
 However, when one digs a little deeper,
 one finds a philosophical clash: This
 competition reflects the intersection 
of crypto legislation, trust, and geopolitical
 influence, going beyond mere
 competition. It appears that USDC is in a
 stronger position to become the
 "compliant default" as the United States
 tightens its regulatory grip—GENIUS Act,
 STABLE Act, etc. The use of USDT,
 however, remains disproportionately high
 in developing economies.
 One can place bets in the area of
 institutional credibility. The second one
 focuses on market entrenchment and
 accessibility. The main concern is whether
 they can live side by side. Or will
 confidence triumph over momentum in the
 end?

 Potential Scenarios & Impact
JP Morgan's Strategic
 Response
 “I have a coin too (trademark pending)!”
 JP Morgan has shifted its focus to deposit
 tokens, highlighting the rapid growth of
 the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Licensed
 banks can issue deposit tokens, which are
 transferable tokens that reflect a deposit
 claim on a blockchain. It functions similarly
 to a bank deposit but with cutting-edge
 technology that allows it to blend in with
 the current regulatory and banking
 systems.
 Stablecoins are disrupting the
 monopolistic rent that banks make from
 payments, and they have been a huge
 success for the cryptocurrency market. In
 2024, they issued over $1 trillion worth of
 tokens, more than Mastercard and Visa
 combined.
 With the release of their new deposit token
 (JPMD) on Coinbase's blockchain BASE, JP
 Morgan is launching a robust
 counterattack on stablecoins. As a
 groundbreaking initiative, JPMD will
 integrate numerous benefits of stablecoins
 with the additional advantages of interest
 payouts, deposit insurance, and
 compatibility with existing account-based
 forms of currency.
 Traditional Finance

 The Deposit Token Revolution
 Fiserv-PayPal Partnership
 A New Model for Stablecoin
 Interoperability
 The announcement of Fiserv's FIUSD
 stablecoin and its partnership with PayPal
 represents a inflection point in traditional
 finance's stablecoin strategy.
 Unlike JP Morgan's closed-loop deposit
 token approach, this partnership
 demonstrates how established financial
 institutions can collaborate to create open,
 interoperable stablecoin ecosystems.
 Fiserv's decision to develop FIUSD as a
 "bank-friendly stablecoin" addresses a
 critical gap in the market. While Circle's
 USDC targets institutional investors and
 Tether's USDT dominates crypto markets,
 FIUSD is designed specifically to enable
 "financial institutions of all sizes to offer
 next-generation banking solutions to their
 consumer and commercial clients."
 The planned interoperability between
 FIUSD and PayPal USD (PYUSD) represents
 the first major initiative to create seamless
 movement between institutional
 stablecoins. This collaboration addresses
 one of the key criticisms of the current
 stablecoin landscape—fragmentation and
 lack of interoperability between different
 token ecosystems.

 Combined Value Proposition – Bridge
 between traditional banking and digital
 payments without forcing banks to

 Some experts suggest that for institutional
 users in particular, deposit tokens will
 serve as a superior alternative to existing
 options for on-chain cash on public
 blockchains. JP Morgan argues that
 deposit tokens represent a superior, more
 secure, and better-integrated form of
 digital currency compared to stablecoins.
 For organizations looking for legal, profit
making, and blockchain-based cash flow,
 JPMD offers major advantages by merging

Asia is at the forefront of global adoption
 of real-world stablecoins. Fireblocks' 2025
 State of Stablecoins report indicates that
 56% of institutions in the region are
 already operational, marking the highest
 adoption rate worldwide. Separately, a
 study commissioned by CoinDesk found
 that the adoption rate of cryptocurrencies
 in the Asia-Pacific region is 22%, which is
 significantly higher than the global
 average of 7.8%.
 Not only that, four of the world's top five
 low- and middle-income countries—
 Pakistan, India, and China—receive
 remittances from this area. Digital
 currencies tied to a particular reserve
 asset, such as the US dollar, offer a buffer
 against economic fluctuations and
 facilitate seamless cross-border
 transactions for numerous individuals in
 the region.
 In the past year, stablecoins have
 facilitated transactions totaling $33 trillion,
 representing approximately 20 times the
 volume processed by PayPal and nearly
 four times that of Visa. The figure is quickly
 approaching that of automated clearing
 houses, as reported by a16z, a venture
 capital firm.

 Regional Innovation and Adoption Patterns
 Singapore
 The Regulatory Gold Standard
 In the field of "regulated innovation,"
 Singapore has emerged as a leader and
 achieved remarkable progress. For
 stablecoins tied to the Singapore dollar
 (SGD) or any G10 currency produced in
 Singapore, the Monetary Authority of
 Singapore (MAS) laid up a comprehensive
 regulatory framework in 2023.
 The framework stipulates a minimum base
 capital for issuers, demands full reserve
 backing, ensures redemption at par value
 within five business days, and imposes
 stringent disclosure and audit criteria.
 With the new regulations in place, licensed
 institutions can launch stablecoins linked
 to SGD, such as XSGD by StraitsX. This
 currency has a market valuation of over
 $18 million, has processed over $8 billion
 in transactions, and is now among the
 most popular.
 Partnerships like the one between StraitsX
 in Singapore and Grab and Ant
 International for international payments
 show how cooperative efforts can
 encourage innovation and build trust.
 12
Hong Kong
 Financial Hub Transformation
 On May 21, 2025, the region enacted the
 Stablecoins Bill, establishing itself as a
 favorable environment for cryptocurrency
 activities. According to this law, any
 enterprise in Hong Kong intending to issue
 stablecoins backed by Hong Kong dollars
 or utilize Hong Kong dollars as collateral is
 required to obtain a license from the
 HKMA.
 Licensed issuers must adhere to rigorous
 regulations in areas such as auditing,
 reserve asset management, AML/CFT
 compliance, risk management, and
 redemption at par. Promotional materials
 for stablecoins should come from
 authorized issuers, and only those
 stablecoins that are issued by licensed
 entities are permitted for sale to retail
 investors.
 Standard Chartered Bank, Animoca
 Brands, and Hong Kong
 Telecommunications are participating in
 pilot programs and regulatory sandboxes
 to foster innovation in Hong Kong.
 The regulatory framework's appeal is
 demonstrated by JD.com's ambitious entry
 into the stablecoin space. Chinese e
commerce titan JD.com has unveiled
 comprehensive plans to apply for
 stablecoin licenses in multiple
 jurisdictions, with Hong Kong as a key
 target. Founder Liu Qiangdong promises to
 revolutionize cross-border payments by
 cutting transaction costs by up to 90%
 while reducing settlement times to under
 10 seconds. Through its subsidiary
 Jingdong Technology, JD.com has
 operated within Hong Kong's fintech
 sandbox since Q1 2024, piloting stablecoin 
use cases for cross-border supplier
 payments.
 JD's existing infrastructure provides
 substantial advantages: the company's
 Zhizhen Chain blockchain network already
 processes approximately $7 billion
 annually  through supply chain finance
 operations, while its logistics footprint
 spans 20 countries. With nearly 600
 million active users across its e-commerce
 platforms, JD's long-term vision extends
 beyond B2B transactions to consumer
 integration, potentially creating one of the
 world's largest consumer digital currency
 ecosystems.
 JD.com joins Ant Group, Alipay's financial
 arm, in pursuing Hong Kong stablecoin
 licenses when the city's new regulatory
 framework takes full effect in August 2025.
 Both companies are also exploring
 approvals in Singapore and Luxembourg,
 demonstrating how Hong Kong serves as a
 regulatory gateway for mainland Chinese
 companies despite China's domestic
 crypto restrictions.
 Japan
 Incremental Integration
 The Payment Services Act (PSA) and the
 Banking Act will be amended to create a
 clear legal framework that differentiates
 stablecoins from other digital assets.
 Despite the lack of a clear definition,
 "stablecoins" are classified under two
 categories under Japanese law: "digital
 money-type stablecoins"—those that are
 pegged to fiat and used as electronic
 payment instruments—and "crypto asset
type stablecoins"—those that are
 structured as crypto assets or securities.

 India's Digital Rupee Strategy
 The RBI has raised alarms regarding
 stablecoins, especially those linked
 to foreign currencies
 Policy approach: Recommends
 thorough prohibition of foreign
currency stablecoins
 CBDC development: Digital rupee
 pilot phases commenced late 2022
 Tax implications: 30% tax on
 cryptocurrency profits, 1% TDS on
 transactions
 Conversely, China and India have adopted a
 more stringent approach, prioritizing their
 respective Central Bank Digital Currencies
 (CBDCs).
 Despite China's domestic crypto restrictions,
 major Chinese corporations are pursuing
 stablecoin strategies through offshore
 jurisdictions. JD.com's Hong Kong stablecoin
 licensing strategy exemplifies how Chinese
 tech giants are navigating regulatory
 constraints while building international digital
 payment capabilities. This approach allows
 companies to maintain compliance with
 domestic restrictions while accessing global
 stablecoin markets through regulated offshore
 entities.
 Meanwhile, the rising popularity of stablecoins
 linked to national currencies is a notable trend
 in Asia. The goals of this move are to exert
 control over the money supply, decrease
 exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange
 rates, and lessen trade and financial
 dependence on the US dollar.

 The CBDC Alternative:
 China & India's Sovereign
 Digital Currency Strategy
The Inflation Hedge
 Phenomenon
 Stablecoins seem to be a lifeline in volatile
 economies. In regions where currencies
 are highly unpredictable, stablecoins can
 be a great instrument for financial
 inclusion and inflation hedging. 
Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America
 topped the world in 2023 with year-over
year growth rates exceeding 40%,
 according to Chainalysis, thanks in large
 part to the practicality of cryptocurrencies
 in these areas.

 The Dollar Dependency
 Dilemma
 Many people consider the dollar to be a
 global haven, but there are disadvantages
 to relying on just one currency. This kind of
 reliance can reduce the financial
 independence and resilience of areas that
 are already susceptible to changes in the
 global economy.
 Stablecoins are attractive because they
 provide greater security than local
 currencies, which may be very
 unpredictable. However, their long-term
 survival hinges on the policies and
 strength of the underlying system.

Infrastructure Development
 The Visa-Yellow Card Partnership
 To facilitate international payments using
 stablecoins in developing economies
 where the cryptocurrency exchange is
 active, Visa and Yellow Card Financial
 inked a partnership. The two parties will
 investigate ways to optimize treasury
 functions, improve liquidity management,
 and facilitate quicker and more
 economical transfers.
 Established in 2016, Yellow Card aims to
 advance the use of stablecoins across
 approximately 20 African nations where it 
operates, leveraging the widespread Visa
 platform to connect with its intended
 audience. Yellow Card is set to introduce
 stablecoin transactions with Visa in at least
 one African market this year, with plans to
 expand to additional markets.
 The momentum is fueled by the enhanced
 uptake of digital technology across Africa,
 with nations like Ghana, Kenya, South
 Africa, and Nigeria implementing
 regulations for the industry. According to
 Edline Murungi, senior legal counsel at
 Yellow Card, the draft legislation in Kenya,
 known as the Virtual Asset Service
 Providers Bill, stands out as the most
 advanced in Africa.

Market Size & Growth
 Projections
 The stablecoin market has experienced
 explosive growth. May 2025 saw a
 staggering $625 billion in trading volume.
 By 2030, the market is expected to reach
 $1.6 trillion (in the base case) and $3.7
 trillion (in the more optimistic scenario),
 according to the Citi Institute's forecasts.
 The entry of major e-commerce platforms
 like JD.com into the stablecoin space
 represents a significant catalyst for market
 expansion. With JD.com's 600 million
 active users and $7 billion in annual
 blockchain-processed transactions, the
 integration of stablecoin payments into
 consumer e-commerce could dramatically
 accelerate adoption beyond traditional
 B2B use cases. 
Founder Liu Qiangdong's projection of
 90% cost reduction and 10-second
 settlement times directly addresses the
 pain points that have limited traditional
 cross-border payment adoption.
 Several uses, including interbank
 settlements, business-to-business
 transactions, remittances, and tokenized
 securities, as well as increased acceptance
 and institutional interest, are likely to drive
 the anticipated expansion.

 The practicality and widespread adoption
 of stablecoins are becoming more reliant
 on their ability to work seamlessly with one
 another. Ensuring liquidity and maintaining
 a cohesive user experience is essential;
 therefore, stablecoins need to operate
 seamlessly as they traverse various

 CBDC Competition &
 Coexistence
 A Center for International Governance
 Innovation paper analyzes the growing
 global trend toward central bank digital
 currencies (CBDCs), investigating how
 central banks are reacting to the dual
 challenges of financial digitalization and
 geopolitical rivalry.
 Stablecoins and CBDCs are rapidly
 transforming the landscape of currency.
 Despite being digital and backed by
 traditional currency, they are not the same
 or moving toward a similar outcome. 
CBDCs focus on the administration and
 implementation of strategies. Stablecoins
 are crafted to prioritize accessibility,
 scalability, and inclusive participation.
 More than 130 nations are currently
 investigating, testing, or implementing
 central bank digital currencies. Some are
 aiming to enhance autonomy in
 international finance, while others
 prioritize quicker and more inclusive
 payment solutions
 Fungible Token (OFT) standard from
 LayerZero, are gaining traction in the
 market. For instance, LayerZero provides
 flexible security options across multiple
 chains and consolidates supply
 management while also catering to a
 significant portion of the stablecoin
 market.

The Path
 Forward
 The stablecoin revolution represents
 more than technological innovation – it
 embodies a fundamental shift in how
 society conceptualizes and implements
 monetary systems. Choices made by
 regulators, businesses, and users today
 will determine whether stablecoins fulfill
 their promise of more efficient, inclusive,
 and stable financial infrastructure or
 become another speculative asset class.
 The integration of stablecoin payments
 into major platforms like JD.com is the
 critical next phase for their evolution,
 bridging institutional adoption with mass
 consumer acceptance. By leveraging the
 existing cross-border operational
 infrastructure of the e-commerce giant,
 JD.com could set a compelling
 precedent for the industry and be the
 catalyst that rapidly accelerates
 mainstream adoption, should the e
commerce giant successfully achieve its
 ambitious cost reduction targets of 90%
 and near-instantaneous settlements
 within their timeline.
 The evidence suggests that stablecoins
 have already achieved critical mass, with
 transaction volumes rivaling traditional
 payment systems and adoption
 accelerating across both developed and
 emerging markets. The regulatory clarity
 provided by legislation like the GENIUS
 Act removes a significant barrier to
 institutional adoption, while innovations
 like deposit tokens demonstrate
 traditional finance's ability to adapt and
 compete.
 However, significant challenges remain.
 The concentration of stablecoin
 issuance among a few providers creates
 systemic risks. The regulatory
 patchwork across jurisdictions
 complicates compliance and creates
 arbitrage opportunities. The potential
 for stablecoins to displace traditional
 banking services raises questions about
 financial stability and monetary policy
 effectiveness.
 Success will require continued
 collaboration between traditional
 finance, fintech innovators, and
 regulatory authorities. The Asian
 markets provide a template for how
 thoughtful regulation can foster
 innovation while maintaining stability.
 The emerging market adoption
 demonstrates stablecoins' potential to
 serve underbanked populations and
 provide economic stability in volatile
 environments.
 As we look toward Citi Institute’s 2030
 targets, the stablecoin market's growth
 trajectory seems assured, but its
 ultimate form—whether dominated by
 private issuers, traditional banks, or
 central bank digital currencies—remains
 uncertain. What is clear is that the
 financial system of the future will be
 increasingly digital, increasingly global,
 and increasingly dependent on the
 infrastructure being built today.
