Digital assets are emerging from  
a retail novelty to the financial 
infrastructure of the future.  
The trajectory is clear, and 
stablecoins—fiat-pegged digital 
currencies—are at the forefront  
of this revolution.
 Distributed ledger technology has been generating 
headlines for more than a decade, even though there 
have been a limited number of use cases. But now, 
that’s poised to change. Stablecoins—blockchain
based tokens issued by regulated private entities—
 could take digital assets into the financial and 
corporate mainstream. 
Figure 1
 Stablecoins’ value is typically pegged to a 
government-issued currency, most commonly the US 
dollar. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or 
Ethereum, Stablecoin’s price stability is maintained by 
private issuers that hold equivalent reserves in highly 
liquid, low-risk assets, often short-term US Treasuries 
or cash. Stablecoins are distinct from central bank 
digital currencies (CBDCs), which are legal tender of 
money issued directly by central banks. 
Unlike other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins offer a 
unique combination of open interoperability, 
settlement flexibility, and integration with 
decentralized ecosystems—features that position 
stablecoins as a foundational layer for programmable, 
instant-value exchange (see figure 1).

The features of stablecoin
 One key feature of stablecoins is atomic settlement, 
which allows for real-time finality without 
counterparty risk. Delays and reconciliation issues in 
traditional settlement are estimated to cost financial 
institutions up to $15 billion a year in lost liquidity, 
failed trades, and operational inefficiencies.
 Stablecoins can also dramatically reduce transaction 
costs. In 2023, global remittance fees averaged 6.2 
percent, reaching even higher in parts of Africa and 
South Asia. Cross-border interbank wires often incur 
charges of between $20 and $80, not including 
hidden foreign exchange (FX) markups. Conversely, 
stablecoin transaction fees on scalable blockchains 
can be as low as a few cents, making them 
particularly compelling for international money flows 
that require several intermediaries, which can drive 
up costs.
 In addition, each stablecoin movement is publicly 
recorded and auditable in real time, enabling 
transaction transparency and traceability to support 
robust compliance, anti-money laundering efforts, 
and cross-border regulatory monitoring. This 
contrasts sharply with the opacity of legacy 
correspondent banking chains. Institutions can also 
layer additional compliance protocols into on-chain 
transactions, including address screening and 
geofencing, ensuring alignment with local and 
international regulatory frameworks.
 The programmability of stablecoins is perhaps most 
transformative. Unlike static money formats, 
stablecoins can be integrated with smart contracts 
that embed conditional logic, unlocking new 
automation capabilities for treasury, payments, and 
capital markets. In trade finance, for example, funds 
can be released automatically upon confirmation of 
goods shipment. In treasury, stablecoins allow CFOs 
to program automatic liquidity rebalancing across 
subsidiaries. In insurance, parametric policies can use 
oracles to trigger payouts autonomously, cutting 
down on processing delays and disputes.
 These advantages are fueling a surge of stablecoin 
adoptions. Payment giants such as Visa and 
Mastercard are piloting stablecoin settlement rails; 
banks such as JPMorgan, BBVA, and Santander have 
announced plans to issue their own stablecoin; and 
payment service providers (PSPs) such as PayPal and 
Stripe are integrating stablecoins into their core suite 
of services. These developments reflect a broader 
shift, as stablecoins evolve from retail novelty to 
institutional-grade financial instruments. 
To shed light on this shifting landscape, we offer five 
insights into the future of stablecoins and how they 
could shape the next era of financial infrastructure.

 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
1. Stablecoins go 
institutional in 2025
 After more than a decade of experimentation and 
volatility, stablecoins are entering a new phase of 
maturity defined by large-scale institutional 
engagement. As of mid-2025, the total stablecoin 
market capitalization has surpassed $ 250 billion, with 
annual on-chain transaction volumes exceeding $25 
trillion, placing stablecoins on par or above some of 
the world’s largest global payment networks. In 
comparison, Visa and Mastercard process $15 trillion 
and $10 trillion a year respectively, and it took them 
more than 50 years to reach those levels. Stablecoin’s 
rapid scale-up of real economic activity reflects not 
only technological readiness but also institutional 
stakeholders’ shifting attitudes.
 Figure 2
 A wave of strategic moves by financial and 
technology heavyweights over the past 12 months 
signals a structural shift in the adoption curve (see 
figure 2). Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge and Privy, two 
key players in the wallet and digital identity space, 
demonstrates a commitment to integrating stablecoin 
infrastructure natively into commerce platforms. 
Worldpay’s partnership with BVNK enables global 
payouts across more than 180 markets. Meanwhile, 
Circle’s IPO success underscores long-run market 
expectations around the institutional monetization of 
stablecoins and the expansion of regulated, fiat
backed issuance. These moves reflect a consensus 
that’s forming across capital markets, payment 
providers, and technology platforms: the stablecoin 
thesis has moved from speculative to strategic.
 As a result, rather than questioning the relevance of 
stablecoins, financial institutions are exploring how 
they can be used, monetized, and integrated into 
their core infrastructure. Banks are evaluating 
stablecoins for wholesale settlement, cash 
management, and cross-border payment solutions. 
Fintechs are embedding them into retail wallets and 
B2B platforms. And PSPs are exploring them as a 
lower-cost alternative to card rails, particularly in 
underbanked or high-fee markets.

 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
What makes 2025 pivotal is not only the scale of 
capital and transactional volume, but also the 
alignment of infrastructure, regulation, and market 
readiness. Jurisdictions such as the UAE, Singapore, 
the UK, the EU, and now the United States already 
give issuers licensing paths, capital thresholds, and 
disclosure duties. July 2025 added a global linchpin: 
the US GENIUS Act, which for the first time creates a 
harmonized federal set of rules for US dollar-pegged 
stablecoins. By mandating onshore issuance, audited 
cash-and-T-bill reserves, and quarterly reporting, it 
delivers clarity, unlocks a safer innovation runway for 
banks and fintechs, and further entrenches US-dollar 
primacy in digital finance.
 Figure 3
 2. Payments power the 
next wave of adoption
 So far, stablecoins have mostly been used in crypto
native environments, namely for trading on 
centralized and decentralized exchanges. Trading still 
accounts for more than 95 percent of global 
stablecoin transaction volumes, creating the 
perception that stablecoins are niche financial 
instruments tied to speculative crypto activity. 
However, this narrative is shifting: payments are now 
the fastest-growing application of stablecoins, thanks 
to the convergence of infrastructure maturity, 
corporate interest, and clear value propositions in 
real-world financial flows (see figure 3).
 Payments are emerging as the fastest-growing application for stablecoin

 —Card-linked payments, where users can spend 
stablecoins from a debit or credit card
 —B2C payments, particularly for payroll and 
freelancer compensation
 Each of these use cases addresses a specific unmet 
need in the payments landscape, particularly in 
cross-border contexts where settlement is slow, costs 
are high, and intermediaries restrict transparency. 
Addressing the pain points has fueled rapid adoption 
and is leading a growing number of fintechs to 
develop stablecoin-based products (see figure 4).
 Stablecoins are increasingly being used to facilitate 
four high-impact payment use cases:
 —B2B payments, including vendor and supplier 
disbursements, cross-border invoicing, and 
institutional collateral transfers
 —P2P payments, such as international remittances 
and wallet-to-wallet transfers

 5 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
One nascent use case that’s poised for explosive 
growth is agentic commerce that combines the 
power of stablecoins and AI. Although adoption in 
e-commerce is still in its infancy, many leading 
platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and Shopify have all 
announced plans to integrate stablecoins. Coinbase 
recently announced the release of the x402 protocol, 
which introduces a powerful enabler for agentic 
payments. The protocol allows for direct stablecoin 
transactions from user wallets to merchants without 
intermediaries or third-party checkout systems. This 
unlocks a new paradigm, which is particularly relevant 
for autonomous AI agents that conduct transactions 
on behalf of users or systems, such as restocking 
inventory, paying for SaaS, or purchasing datasets.

 3. Distribution is the 
engine of value creation 
In a simplified form, the stablecoin value chain 
consists of four interdependent roles (see figure 5). 
While stablecoin issuers such as Circle and Tether 
have grown their revenue by minting tokens and 
earning yield on the outstanding float, the value 
capture is moving upstream toward distribution. 
These are the players with the trusted user interface, 
regulatory licenses, and financial products that wrap 
stablecoins in practical use cases that are ultimately 
making them mainstream. Although any company 
can issue a stablecoin, an emerging strategic play is 
to partner with trusted issuers and orchestrators to 
focus on customer acquisition, product innovation, 
and user engagement.

4. Local stablecoins will 
unlock more use cases
 Although US dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDT 
still dominate the market, collectively accounting for 
more than 95 percent of circulating stablecoin value, 
non-US-dollar stablecoins are emerging as critical 
enablers of domestic and regional payments. In many 
jurisdictions, including the UAE, Singapore, the EU, 
and Hong Kong, regulatory clarity, monetary stability, 
and high trade interconnectivity are creating fertile 
ground for stablecoin innovation beyond the dollar 
(see figure 6).
 We are already seeing this play out in the market. 
Rather than issue its own stablecoin, NuBank, Latin 
America’s largest digital bank, allows its more than 90 
million users to hold US dollar-backed stablecoins, 
earn yield, and make cross-border payments, all 
wrapped in a trusted banking app. Issuers are also 
adapting to this new reality. Circle’s launch of the 
Circle Payments Network signals a pivot from issuer 
to full-stack payments platform, an attempt to extend 
beyond treasury reserves management and capture 
downstream value. This presents a sizable 
opportunity for financial institutions and PSPs to enter 
the emerging digital assets space by leveraging their 
existing client base and distribution while limiting 
investments and shortening the time to market.

 Key beneits:
 Regulatory clarity: establishes a clear, uniform set of rules 
for US dollar-pegged stablecoins
 On-shore issuance: requires major stablecoin operators to 
domicile, hold reserves, and report under US jurisdiction 
(a direct answer to offshore players such as Tether)
 Innovation runway: gives intechs and banks a predictable 
framework to safely launch new digital asset products
 US dollar primacy: anchors the growing stablecoin market 
to US dollar reserves, reinforcing the dollar’s role as the 
world’s reserve currency
 7 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
This shift is both inevitable and necessary. Although 
still the dominant currency in global trade and capital 
markets, the US dollar’s use in regional or domestic 
payments often introduces unwanted FX exposure, 
legal complexity, and operational friction. For 
example, a non-US business paying its suppliers in 
the same country in US dollars still incurs FX spreads 
and regulatory compliance burdens, even when both 
parties transact in the same native currency. Non-US
dollar stablecoins eliminate this inefficiency, enabling 
near-instant, local-currency digital payments with the 
same programmability and composability as their 
dollar-backed counterparts. In the case of regional 
trade, this can be particularly relevant for corridors 
with high-volume cross-border flows, such as 
between the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.
 As stablecoins gain traction, they can also facilitate the 
formation of on-chain FX markets, allowing entities to 
swap digital currencies programmatically and at a 
lower cost. Unlike today’s fragmented FX ecosystem, 
where spreads, intermediaries, and delays inflate 
costs, an on-chain FX market using stablecoins could 
offer real-time, transparent, and disintermediated 
currency exchange, a major benefit for corporations, 
treasurers, and cross-border platforms.
 Regulatory clarity is proving to be the primary catalyst 
for this evolution. The jurisdictions moving fastest to 
define stablecoin rules are already attracting issuers, 
orchestrators, and financial institutions eager to 
experiment and scale. A case in point is the UAE, 
which in June 2024 issued its Payment Token 
Services Regulation, the first comprehensive 
framework in the Middle East for regulating local 
fiat-referenced tokens (stablecoins). Issuers must be 
licensed and meet strict reserve, redemption, and 
reporting standards, creating a clear legal path for 
both bank-issued and fintech-issued stablecoins. 
Singapore’s Project Orchid, the EU’s Markets in 
Crypto-Assets Regulation, and Hong Kong’s 
upcoming stablecoin licensing regime reflect similar 
momentum toward formalizing stablecoin activities 
under financial supervision. The United States, India, 
Saudi Arabia, and many other countries are expected 
to follow suit in the coming year. 
As regional stablecoins proliferate, use cases will 
expand into treasury, trade finance, and other key 
verticals that can benefit from low-cost and real-time 
settlement. For PSPs, banks, and corporations, this 
opens the door to more localized, efficient, and 
compliant payment models that reduce reliance on 
the US dollar, especially where it adds complexity 
without adding value.
 5. Stablecoins will grow 
10x but are not a one-size
fits-all solution
 The trajectory for stablecoins is exponential rather 
than linear. Over the next several years, stablecoins 
are poised to grow 10x in market capitalization, fueled 
by deeper integration across major financial and 
payment platforms and growing institutional 
acceptance. What was once a fringe innovation 
confined to crypto exchanges is now rapidly 
becoming a core component of global financial 
infrastructure.
 Two interlocking forces are fueling this acceleration:
 —Distribution scale. Mainstream PSPs such as Visa, 
Mastercard, Worldpay, and Stripe are rolling out 
stablecoin-based settlement and payout 
capabilities, integrating stablecoins as live rails for 
cross-border payments, merchant settlement, and 
treasury disbursement. 
—Institutional trust. Traditional financial institutions 
are entering the stablecoin economy, either by 
issuing their own fiat-backed tokens (for example, 
JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, and Société Générale’s 
EURCV) or integrating regulated third-party 
stablecoins into client offerings. 
8
 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
These dual entry points are creating the conditions 
for stablecoins to evolve from a $250 billion market to 
a multitrillion-dollar asset class over the next few 
years. However, stablecoins are not a one-size-fits-all 
solution, and they won’t replace traditional rails 
across the board. Adoption will be selective and 
complementary, depending on the specific use case. 
For example, in many low-value domestic 
transactions, instant payment networks are still more 
efficient and cost-effective than on-chain payments, 
especially where interoperability and fee structures 
have already been optimized. In large-value or 
interbank settlement scenarios, CBDCs and tokenized 
deposits may offer stronger central bank guarantees 
and more familiar regulatory frameworks. In other 
words, stablecoins will coexist, not compete, with a 
spectrum of digital and legacy payment systems. 
That being said, their programmability and 
composability are more than a technical upgrade and 
could unlock new financial primitives and use cases.
 Figure 7
 A four-pronged decision
making framework 
More than a technological evolution, stablecoins 
represent a fundamental shift in the way value is 
stored, transferred, and monetized across financial 
systems. As this new money layer gains traction, 
forward-thinking organizations across banking, 
payments, and capital markets are redefining their 
digital asset management strategies to explore 
stablecoins as a new payment rail, a tool for treasury 
innovation, or an enabler for agentic commerce. 
Common success factors include focusing on use 
cases that address real customer needs, seamless 
integration into existing systems, and diligent 
implementation in a multi-stakeholder environment. 
Our decision-making framework addresses four core 
components of an effective stablecoin offering (see

 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
In this expansive landscape of opportunities, forward
thinking organizations are recognizing and planning 
for the associated risks. Our balanced, risk-aware 
approach to stablecoin implementation helps 
companies pull the right governance, controls, and 
mitigation levers:
 Custody risk. Choosing between custodial versus 
non-custodial models requires making some trade
offs in user control, regulatory exposure, and cyber
risk. Custody design must account for wallet security, 
key management, and user protection, especially in 
light of past breaches.
 Instant settlement and reversibility. The atomic 
nature of stablecoin transactions introduces 
challenges around fraud, chargebacks, and dispute 
resolution. Real-time fraud monitoring and 
transaction-level conditionality will be essential to 
protecting consumers.
 Tools for compliance, anti-money laundering (AML) 
and know your customer (KYC). Given the pseudo
anonymity and decentralized nature of 
cryptocurrencies, stablecoin participants must adopt 
the required AML/KYC tools to prevent money 
laundering and ensure regulatory compliance. 
Stablecoins 
have claimed 
their space 
in the global 
payments 
landscape.
 Charting the way into the 
future of payments
 Stablecoins have claimed their space in the global 
payments landscape, and it’s clear they are here to 
stay. PayPal is pushing PYUSD onto Stellar to power 
e-commerce and remittance flows; Société Générale’s 
USD CoinVertible will be the first US dollar-pegged 
token from a G-SIB bank; Mitsubishi UFJ is preparing a 
yen coin under Japan’s new stable-asset statute; 
Standard Chartered and partners are vying to mint an 
HK-dollar stablecoin under Hong Kong’s VASP regime; 
and Australia’s ANZ is already using A$DC in cross
border pilots across Asia Pacific. What’s fueling this 
“stablecoin goldrush” is the convergence of clearer 
rulebooks; merchants demanding sub-second, low-fee 
settlement; and banks and tech giants scrambling to 
defend payments revenue. For decision-makers, the 
message is clear: move now or lose out on the next 
generation of money.
 Navigating the stablecoin landscape demands not 
only technical literacy but strategic clarity and 
operational foresight. At Kearney, we combine deep 
financial expertise, hands-on digital fluency, and a 
global ecosystem view to help our clients lead in this 
next wave of innovation.
