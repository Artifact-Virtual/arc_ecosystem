# Technology, Payments, and the Rise of Stablecoins

*Finance & Development, September 2025* three years ago, Finance & Development
devoted a full issue to anticipating “The Money Revolution,” driven
by innovations in finance, such as crypto assets. That rev olution is now
unfolding.
 This issue of F&D looks at the new frontiers of finance,
where technology, data, and changing societal values are reshaping how
people and institutions move money and trade financial assets, who provides
liquidity, and where new risks are brewing. We bring together academics
and policymakers to assess this complex and politically charged landscape,
one that generates excitement and anxiety in equal measure.
 Stablecoins are one of these frontiers, a form of digital
asset backed by currencies or government bonds. Stablecoin companies have
racked up millions of users globally, trans acting across borders 24/7 at very
low cost. New legislation in the US and other countries may further boost
their growth.  Hélène Rey, a professor at the London Business School,
assesses the macroeconomic and geopolitical implica tions of widespread
adoption of US dollar–denominated stablecoins around the world. On the
positive side: faster and cheaper cross-border payments. On the negative:
risk of dollarization, capital flows and exchange rate volatil ity, potential
weakening of the banking system, money laundering and other financial
crimes. While it’s hard to forecast how the use of this technology will play
out, it’s “likely to create major financial stability risks,” she writes.
 Yao Zeng of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton
School identifies one potential source of risk: “The global f
 inancial landscape has changed, yet the rules remain
largely unchanged.” He puts stablecoins in the context of broader
changes in financial markets. For example, lightly regulated nonbanks
are providing more liquidity.  And lenders are increasingly relying on AI
and big data to speed loan approvals, reduce collateral requirements, and
reach borrowers traditional banks often overlook. One thing is clear, he
writes. “Stablecoins may function well in good times, but they can falter
under stress.” Stablecoins are only one facet of the revolution. The public
and the private sector alike are driving innovation.  Some governments and
central banks have responded to private payment initiatives by sponsoring
systems “New entrants like fintechs and big techs, and new products like
crypto and stablecoins, are challenging incumbent financial institutions.”
 that respond to consumer demand for
fast, efficient payments. IMF research ers examine the case of India’s
Unified Payments Interface, which intercon nects hundreds of banks, platforms,
and apps and carries out more than 19 billion transactions a month.
 At the same time, central banks and
supervisors must contend with disrup tive innovation. New entrants like
fin techs and big techs, and new products like crypto and stablecoins, are
chal lenging incumbent financial institutions.  Iñaki Aldasoro, Jon Frost,
and Vatsala Shreeti, from the Bank for International Settlements, explore how
competition among the new entrants and incum bents might unfold. They conclude
that forward-looking public policies must accompany radical innovation to
achieve the most impactful breakthroughs.
 Preventing crime is another area in
which public authorities need to stay alert. Criminals, unfortunately, were
among the earliest adopters of crypto, and all payment systems need to bal
ance privacy and speed with the need to stop tax evasion, money laundering,
and terrorism financing. Stanford’s Darrell Duffie and coauthors lay out
a practical approach to getting ahead of the curve.
 Clearly, there is a lot of room for
innovation in payment systems and financial markets in general. Users demand
it. The key is to balance the risks and benefits through clear regula tion
that protects consumers and inves tors and limits spillovers. Who knows what
new possibilities such innovations will unlock along the way? F&D

threats to central bank independence.”
 global growth is projected at 3.0
percent for 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026, according to the IMF’s July 2025
World Economic Outlook Update. This upward revision from the April forecast
reflects front-loading in anticipation of higher tariffs, lower effective
tariff rates, easier financial conditions, and fiscal expansion in some
major economies.
 Global inflation is expected to fall, but
US inflation is predicted to stay above tar get, the flagship report
notes. Downside risks from potentially higher tariffs, ele vated uncertainty,
and geopolitical ten sions persist.
 Restoring confidence, predictability,
and sustainability remains a key policy priority, according to the report.
 Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s
economic counsellor and Research Department director, noted that “projec
tions remain about 0.2 percentage points below our pre-April forecasts,
indicating that the trade tensions are hurting the global economy.”
 “A breakdown in trade talks, or renewed
protectionism, could dampen growth globally and fuel inflation in some
coun tries,” Gourinchas said. However, he added that “on the upside,
breakthroughs in trade negotiations could boost confi dence, and structural
reforms could lift long-term productivity.”

Tokens Are Finance’s Newest and Oldest Innovation
 Money has taken many forms over millennia;
digital tokens are the latest
 8 F &D Back to Basics Itai Agur thousands of years ago, long
before coins, paper money, credit cards, and banking apps, our ancestors bought
and sold goods using cowries, a type of seashell. These shiny physical tokens
were humankind’s first financial innova tion. What made them especially
useful was that they were easy to verify: When someone handed you a cowrie
shell, you could see it, feel it, and trust that it had value. You didn’t
need a middleman to verify the transaction.
 Cash still works this way today.
When you pay someone with a banknote, the deal is done—no delays. But when
it comes to digital transactions, pay ments only seem instant. Behind the
scenes, banks and credit card networks take over as intermediaries, approving
and settling the transaction later. They take on the settlement risk—the
danger that one party will renege on its end of the bargain. Intermediaries
ensure that both parties keep their promises.
 It takes time to manage settlement
risk through intermediaries. This mat ters in cases where settlement delays
are costly, especially when trading stocks, bonds, or other securities in
financial markets. A clearinghouse collects the seller’s asset and the
buyer’s payment and exchanges them one or two days later. In places like
Wall Street, time is money. J.P. Morgan estimates that asset management
costs could be cut by about a fifth if the settlement of trades and the
reinvestment of sale proceeds were immediate.
 Financial innovators aim to cut inter
mediation costs by bringing the imme diacy of exchanging physical tokens to
the digital world. The challenge is that when transacting parties don’t
meet face-to-face, they cannot see the assets they are trading before
completing an exchange. Programmability provides a solution—a piece of
code that ensures the buyer’s money and the seller’s asset are locked in
and then exchanged at the same moment. The funds received can be reinvested
automatically, saving valuable time and money.
 Digital intermediaries Tokenization creates assets on a pro
grammable ledger, a recordkeeping system for financial transactions that
market participants can trust and share access to. Assets such as a stock
or bond can be issued directly on the ledger, or they might be a representa
tion of an asset that exists outside the ledger, such as stock on the New
York Stock Exchange. In the latter case, an intermediary still needs to hold
the rep resented asset safely in the background.
 Tokenization can spur competition
between intermediaries. To trade in f
 inancial markets, investors are often
required by regulation to use brokers.  Switching assets from one broker to
another is a hassle that requires the services of a specialized clearinghouse.
Alternatively, an investor can sell all assets owned through one broker and
repurchase them through another, but that comes with a trading cost. Tokeni
zation, however, allows data to be trans ferred among brokers with the click
of a button. It makes it simpler for investors to shop around and switch
between bro kers for the best price.
 Tokenization does not cut out all
middlemen, but it is reshaping the financial industry and reducing the need
for certain roles. Registrars are intermediaries that manage asset own ership

 irst dominoes to fall in the financial sec
tor,” it says. Programmability adds to an already complex financial
landscape and makes it harder for regulators to keep tabs on potential risks.
 How much debt participants in a
financial market owe each other has often made the difference between a
financial ripple and a tsunami. Debt amplifies shocks because it implies a
promise to repay—and nothing rocks confidence like broken repayment prom
ises. Tokenization can make it easier to such as dividends or interest from a
firm to the asset owners. On a token ledger such payments are made directly to
the token holders, automating the role of registrars and putting them out of
a job.  Tokenization works best when money and assets flow smoothly. If dif
ferent companies build their own token ledgers that don’t work together,
the f
 inancial system could fragment into
silos. It is possible to design ledgers so that they can talk to each other,
but this interoperability requires planning and coordination. This is why
policymakers want to make sure that tokenized sys tems stay open, connected,
and stable.
 Flash crashes Tokenization’s greater efficiency does
not come without risk. Faster driving can save time, but it also makes crashes
more likely to occur and more serious when they do. The same is true for finan
cial markets. Faster, automated trad ing has already led to sudden crashes,
known as “flash crashes,” such as the 2010 Wall Street flash crash,
when an estimated $1 trillion was briefly wiped off the value of stocks
listed on the exchange. By making it easier to pro gram and instantly execute
automated trading rules, tokenized markets can be riskier and more volatile.
Financial crises often unfold like falling dominoes, with one failure set ting
off the next, as occurred during the 2008–09 crisis, when global giants
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG all collapsed within the space of
six months.  On a token ledger, chains of programs can be written on top of
each other, act ing like a programmed set of falling dominoes during a crisis.
 Tokenization and programmability
also make it easier to create complex f
 inancial products, with risks regula
tors may not understand fully until it’s too late. This was true of the
nonpro grammable assets that soured during the 2008–09 crisis and led the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Report to conclude that a “complexity bubble”
burst at the same time as the real estate bubble. “The securities almost

 build up debt, because investors or insti
tutions can use tokens as collateral to borrow and then invest that money
else where. If one part fails—if a token loses value, say—it could
trigger losses across the system.
 Hybrid technology Financial assets started off as paper
records and evolved into digital ledgers and programmable tokens. This trend
is now expanding to nonfinancial assets such as real estate and potentially
even agricultural collateral like farmland and livestock. But physical
assets cannot be fully digitalized—they still require phys ical care to
maintain their value, as a farmer tends to a herd of cattle or the pasture
where they graze. The tokeniza tion of nonfinancial assets is best seen as
a hybrid between physical and financial technology.
 From the ancient world’s cowrie
shells to today’s digital tokens, human society has come to accept
different mediums of exchange. The latest inno vations offer clear rewards
by speed ing transactions and making trading cheaper. But there are risks,
too. Speed, complexity, and risky debt have all con tributed to previous
financial crises—
 and tokenization adds to all of them.
As with any innovation, digital tokens should be handled with care. F&D

 Point of View Why Europe Needs
a Digital Euro
 Philip R. Lane It would safeguard monetary stability, fend off private payment
monopolies, and stand as a potent symbol of European unity
 prudence suggests that the retail role
should be preserved, including through the introduction of a digital euro.
Central banks have a mandate to safeguard monetary stability in all cir
cumstances. This calls for a cautious yet forward-looking approach that
takes into account not only baseline scenarios but also tail risks of the
future development of the monetary system. A digital euro will minimize
the likelihood of adverse economic outcomes in the future and ensure the
resilience of the monetary system in an increasingly digital world.
 Cash issued by the central bank
has historically played a critical role in maintaining trust in the
convertibility of commercial bank money to central bank money. While
convertibility is largely The digital euro project has a simple motivation:
to ensure that people in a digital world retain the option to make or receive
payments in central bank money. Supplementing physical cash with digital
cash will support the modernization of the traditional two-tier monetary
system that allows both cash and bank deposits as a medium of exchange.
The evolution of the two-tier monetary system over the past 300 years has
provided a strong foundation for the operation of the broader financial system
and has enabled central banks to deliver price stability effectively. While
it is possible to theorize about alternative monetary systems in which central
bank money plays only a wholesale role, taken for granted, it’s not obvious
that the two-tier monetary system would necessarily remain stable if ongoing
digitalization meant that convertibility to physical cash lost relevance
and a dig ital cash option was not made available.  Monopoly power
 Compared with other services, pay
ment instruments exhibit exception ally strong network externalities—they
gain value as more people use them.  This is one reason using central bank
money for payments improves eco nomic efficiency: It limits the scope for
commercial payment systems to exploit monopoly power by charging excessive
fees. As the share of digital transactions increases, the option to make
payments in digital euros can limit the potential monopoly power of the
firms at the center of private sector payment networks.  In addition,
public access to central bank money provides a reliable fallback option
to using commercial bank money for some types of transactions if there is
disruption of the commercial banking system, whether from technical prob
lems or a cyberattack. This is one reason policymakers want a digital euro
to work offline as well as online.  Illustration by Chantal Jahchan

Point of View
 F&D “If banks and other payment service providers carry out the necessary
 know
your-customer checks, maximum privacy will be maintained, and the central
bank will not be privy to individual account details.”
 Some argue that an alternative
approach in adapting the monetary system to a digital age would be to pro mote
stablecoins, issued and operated by private sector intermediaries. How ever,
stablecoins are best understood as expanding the private money universe—
 as another substitute for bank depos
its—rather than as a true substitute for central bank money. A stable value
of a stablecoin in terms of currency is not intrinsic (unlike a liability of
the central bank). Even a highly liquid backing port folio does not guarantee
convertibility under all scenarios.  By contrast, a well-designed digital
euro promises to modernize the two tier monetary system without destabi
lizing financial institutions or disrupt ing monetary policy implementation
or transmission. Among other fea tures, appropriately calibrated limits on
digital euro holdings can provide people sufficient digital cash for trans
actions while preventing excessive outflows from commercial banks and outsize
expansion of the central bank balance sheet.  Moreover, since people will set
up digital euro accounts primarily via their banks (or other payment service
pro viders), close interconnection will con tinue between central bank money
and commercial bank money. If banks and other payment service providers carry
out the necessary know-your-customer checks, maximum privacy will be main
tained, and the central bank will not be privy to individual account details.
Unifying fragmented markets
 For the euro area, a digital euro offers
additional benefits in a multicountry monetary union. Among other factors,
the euro area payment system is highly fragmented along national lines: Cus
tomers must typically rely on non-Eu ropean card or e-wallet providers to make
payments across the euro area. By mandating acceptance of a digital euro,
instant network effects would help unify the currently fragmented market.
A digital euro would reduce costs for merchants and businesses by pro viding
the network infrastructure for an area-wide payment system on a not for-profit
basis. It would increase bar gaining power vis-à-vis international card
networks for both in-person trans actions and e-commerce. A digital euro
thereby promises to enable an area wide fast payment system at the point of
interaction (POI) between customers and merchants. With conflicting incen
tives across operators of legacy national payment systems, such an area-wide
POI fast payment system will not likely develop without a digital euro.
 A digital euro would also provide an
important foundation for fintech inno vation across the continent. A standard
ized, pan-European platform would allow private providers to innovate while
benefiting from the economies of scale of the underlying digital euro
network, ultimately reducing costs for consumers and businesses alike.
In particular, by linking customers and merchants across the euro area
via a system of digital euro accounts, card and e-wallet providers could
focus on additional payment services while the underlying payments travel
via the rails of a digital euro system. Separation of the basic plumbing of
the payment sys tem (the digital euro network) from the delivery of add-on
services also lowers the risk of lock-in effects—when one pri vate payment
network with a transitory technological advantage suppresses subsequent
innovation in order to keep the upper hand.
 Symbol of unity To sum up, a retail role for central
bank money is arguably integral to the sovereign foundations of the mon
etary system. In particular, the single ness, effectiveness, and stability
of the monetary system are ultimately underpinned by the sovereign (or, in
the case of the euro area, the joint sovereignty of the European Union’s
member states). The monetary role of the sovereign spans the institutional
foundations of the monetary system (including the definition and enforce
ment of legal tender), the maintenance of the budgetary discipline required
to ensure that monetary policy is insu lated from fiscal dominance, and
the delegation of various monetary tasks to the central bank.  A retail
role for central bank money maintains the direct monetary relation ship
between the sovereign and the citi zen. It reinforces public understanding
that monetary stability is intrinsic to sov ereignty. This consideration is
especially relevant in a European context, with the common currency seen as a
critical mechanism for greater economic and political integration among member
countries. Beyond its economic and monetary roles, the euro is an important
symbol of European unity. This must be maintained in a digital age. F&D

 Point of View Behind the Veil
of Tariff Fixation
 Michael Pettis The world needs a broader conception of trade policy
that considers how economies allocate income
 In the heated debates over trade policy in Washington
and beyond, tariffs are often portrayed as the pri mary—or even the
sole—instrument by which gov ernments intervene in global commerce. They
are easy to quantify, easier to politicize, and readily wielded in bilateral
negotiations.
 But this focus on tariffs is misleading. It obscures the
more fundamental mechanisms by which countries shape their trade
relationships with the world. Because a country’s internal imbalances
between consumption and produc tion must always be consistent with its
external imbalances, anything that affects the former must affect the latter,
and vice versa. Tariffs are just one of many tools a government can use to
change a country’s internal imbalance.
 Like most such tools, tariffs work by shifting income
from consumers to producers. But because of their vis ibility, they are often
among the most politically con tentious of these tools. By contrast, many of
the most powerful trade interventions in today’s world occur not as tariffs
but as policy choices that don’t appear to be related to trade at all. Fiscal
decisions, regulatory struc tures, labor policies, and institutional norms can
all affect how income is distributed, and how economies are bal anced between
consumption and pro duction, with far-reaching implications for global trade.
 To understand why tariffs receive
such disproportionate attention, it helps to consider their visibility. A
tariff is a line item in a trade negotiation affect ing the price of an
imported good. It’s easy to identify, easy to weaponize, easy to reverse,
and very obviously linked to trade. But the very simplicity that makes a tariff
politically salient also makes it a poor proxy for trade policy as a whole.
 Income transfer At its core, a tariff is a tax on imports.
By making foreign goods more expen sive, it gives domestic producers a pric
ing advantage. This can benefit certain industries and preserve jobs. But
those benefits come at a cost: Consumers pay more for goods and services. The
net effect is to transfer income from house holds to businesses, and it is
this transfer that, by reducing the household share of GDP, reduces overall
consumption rela tive to production.
 This shifting of income from con
sumers to producers is the essence of trade intervention. Whether through a
tariff, a tax subsidy, or a wage-suppress ing labor law, the result is a change
in the internal distribution of income that also has external implications. If
con sumption is taxed and production is subsidized, net exports are likely
to rise.  Conversely, if policies shift income from producers to consumers,
net exports are likely to fall. In this sense, any policy that affects the
balance between household consumption and total output will also COURTESY

 affect the balance between domestic
saving and domestic investment, and so is effectively a trade policy.
 Consider currency policy. When a
country intervenes in foreign exchange markets to keep its currency underval
“As John Maynard Keynes argued at Bretton Woods in F&D
 The point is that trade imbalances
are not just about what happens at the border. They are a consequence of
how economies are structured internally—
 how income is distributed, how much
ued, it achieves the same goals as a tar iff. A weaker currency makes
imports more expensive and exports cheaper, subsidizing production and
taxing con sumption. Like tariffs, this represents a transfer of income
from net importers (the household sector) to net exporters (the tradable
goods sector), but it occurs through exchange rates rather than in the form
of tariffs.  Financial repression can have the same effect. In countries
in which the banking system serves mainly the sup ply side of the economy,
suppressing interest rates is effectively a tax on the income of net savers
(the household sector) and a credit subsidy for net bor rowers (the producing
sector). By trans ferring income from the former to the latter, it creates
a domestic imbalance—
 just like the one created by tariffs or an
undervalued currency—between con sumption and production. This shows up
in the form of higher net exports.
 Strategic subsidies Tax and regulatory policies can work
similarly. Governments might provide direct or indirect subsidies to strategic
industries, including by building infra structure tailored to manufacturing
clusters. These measures may not vio late international rules on trade inter
vention, but they change relative incen tives within the economy in ways that
mirror traditional protectionism. By making it cheaper or more attractive
to produce than to consume, they achieve the same end: an internal shift
that pro duces an external effect.
 Even labor market structures and
social institutions can function as tools of trade intervention. In China,
for example, the hukou system—a house hold registration system that limits
rural migrants’ rights in urban areas—
 has long served to depress wages
and reduce household consumption.  Although designed mainly to manage
urbanization, the hukou system directly 1944, the fact that a diversified

 affects China’s trade balance by limiting
the growth of domestic demand relative to domestic supply.  Similar effects can
be seen in poli cies that encourage environmental deg radation (by increasing
business prof itability at the expense of health care costs), restrict labor
from organizing, hold down minimum wages, or reduce the bargaining power
of workers. By suppressing wage growth and limiting consumption relative to
productivity growth, these policies create the same kinds of imbalances as
tariffs, but they do so far more quietly.
 This broader perspective helps
explain why some countries have run persistent trade surpluses even as they
maintain relatively low tariffs. These economies have long emphasized pro
duction over consumption, whether through institutional structures, sav ing
incentives, or export-oriented indus trial policies. The result is the same:
If domestic demand is too weak to absorb national output, these countries
must externalize the cost of weak domestic demand by running trade surpluses.
 households spend relative to what busi
nesses produce, and how governments balance the competing demands of pro
ducers and consumers.
 Implicit intervention When governments pursue policies that
favor investment over consumption, or capital over labor, they are engag
ing implicitly in trade intervention—
 whether they intend to or not. And as
surplus countries implement domestic policies that prioritize producers over
consumers, the deficit countries with which they trade are effectively pri
oritizing consumers over producers, whether they choose to or not.
 A narrow focus on tariffs is mislead
ing. It distracts from the underlying drivers of trade imbalances and invites
counterproductive responses. As John Maynard Keynes argued at Bretton Woods
in 1944, the fact that a diversi f
 ied economy runs persistent trade sur
pluses is usually sufficient evidence of trade-distorting
interventions. Whether or not these distortions are created by tariffs is
largely irrelevant; in fact, to the extent that tariffs in deficit economies
can force down trade imbalances, they may actually promote freer trade.
Rather than railing against tariffs, the world needs a broader concep tion of
trade policy—one that moves beyond the surface-level debate over tariffs
and looks inward at how econ omies allocate income. If trade imbal ances
are ultimately the result of inter nal choices about who gets what, then
fixing them will require more than bilateral deals or protectionist gestures.
It requires a change in how countries structure their economies. It requires
power and resources to shift toward those whose spending drives sustain able
demand. F&D

 Point of View Multilateralism
Can Survive the Loss of Consensus
 Danny Quah International cooperation can advance, even
when the most powerful players are at odds
 to counter communism.  Multilateralism is splintering today— not because
 of geopolitical competi
tion alone—but because it’s an expen sive global public good. It benefits
all humanity but distributes costs unevenly across nations.
 Even in today’s polarized world,
geopolitical rivals can still agree on common goals—the planet should
be hospitable to human beings, the next pandemic should be controlled and
confined through sensible public health safeguards, global economic policy
should yield prosperity for all. Nations might disagree on how to achieve these
goals—arguing that one approach or another unfairly benefits a rival—or
they might accuse others of free riding by failing to contribute toward
solving a common problem.  Carbon, for example, has been accu mulating in
the atmosphere for centu ries. How should we divide the burden of tackling
climate change between past and present emitters? Or how should we share
responsibility for pro viding financial stability and restoring global
growth? An advanced economy might expend considerable resources to ensure
growth and stability while others fail to behave prudently.
 Middle powers Can adversarial nations work together for the com
mon good? It’s natural to despair over prospects for international
cooperation given the state of the world order. Geopolitical competition is
straining the multilateral system, which has helped maintain global stability
since the Cold War. The most powerful nations cannot seem to agree on how to
solve urgent global prob lems, from the climate crisis to governing economic
com petition and international trade to regulating artificial intelligence.
Geopolitical competition doesn’t naturally advance international
cooperation. The economic historian Charles Kindleberger showed how a lack
of global lead ership and international cooperation prolonged the Great
Depression. Yet at other times geopolitical competition has, paradoxically,
raised international cooperation.  During the Cold War, for example, Presidents
Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy advanced US leadership in open markets,
free trade, and other global public goods If great powers refuse to support
the international system, can others take their place? Global public goods
are costly to provide. Small poor econo mies don’t have the resources
to patrol the seas to keep shipping lanes safe for international commerce
or to pump trillions into the world economy when markets fail. But middle
powers—those with sufficient economic and financial f
 irepower—may be candidates to take
over the role of great powers. And mid dle powers that are not on the
front lines of great rivalries and are committed to rules-based order are
in fact playing an increasingly consequential role.  Without continuing US

 Inadvertent cooperation First, policymakers should seek opportuni

countries agree on a common solution to a prob lem and can lay out explicit
articles of collaboration. Inadvertent cooperation, however, means that
countries cooper ate even when they disagree: It’s about doing the right
thing even if for the wrong reason.  Inadvertent cooperation is most evi

one country considers that a competi tor is unfairly subsidizing production
of electric vehicles, it could subsidize its own production rather than
slapping tariffs on its adversary. Such subsidies are a sharp riposte to its
adversary but also increase the supply of affordable clean-energy vehicles,
which reduces carbon emissions. It’s a good outcome for all, even though
everyone is acting for the wrong reasons.
 Prisoners’ dilemma Second, policymakers in smaller nations
should nudge the international system out of gridlock. When all countries
seek their own self-interest, a prisoners’ dilemma can result: Every
country acts in ways that are individually optimal but mutually destructive
when taken collectively. No country can free itself from the dilemma: If
it tries to do so unilaterally, others take advantage.  When great powers
get caught this way, a small nudge can persuade them to change course and
pursue a collec tively preferred outcome.  Advanced economies, for example,
often hesitate to grant emerging econ omies greater access to their markets.
Instead they put up barriers to trade, depriving developing economies of
opportunities to become richer, which in turn drives outward migration. This
ratchets up political tensions on all sides. If developing economies can
persuade advanced economies to act as a group, the impact of freer trade
is minimized; imports are spread across the advanced economies, and rising
incomes in developing economies reduce the incentive to migrate. Nudg ing
can help great and middle powers do what they want to do but cannot for fear
of losing out to adversaries.
 Pathfinder multilateralism Third, policymakers should strive for
pathfinder multilateralism. When some nations turn their backs on multilateral
ism, subgroups of countries that favor it can still work together. The World
Trade Organization’s Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement
(MPIA) provides an independent appeals pro cess to resolve trade disputes
when the main appellate body can’t function for lack of a quorum. MPIA
membership has tripled to more than 50 nations since 2020. In pathfinder
multilateralism coa litions act together to overcome prob lems. While the
focus is different, these arrangements resemble what the IMF has called
“pragmatic multilateralism.”
 The Regional Comprehensive Eco
nomic Partnership is another example.  The 15-nation free trade agreement
is committed to rules-based order; it’s an inclusive arrangement and,
as well as members of the Association of South east Asian Nations (ASEAN),
includes countries as politically diverse as Austra lia, China, Japan, New
Zealand, and South Korea. Even as multilateralism is in retreat elsewhere,
ASEAN countries continue to promote it in the Asia-Pacific region.
 International cooperation through
multilateralism may seem impossible now, with consensus falling, particu
larly between geopolitical rivals. Yet inadvertent cooperation, overcoming
the prisoners’ dilemma, and pathfinder multilateralism can restore the
best of the international system. F&D

 FINANCE CHANGED,   RISKS DIDN’T New technologies are rewiring liquidity,
payments, and economic stability
 Yao Zeng Illustration by Keith Negley F&D 19 SEPTEMBER 2025
F&D
 M Frontiers of Finance ore than 15 years after the global finan
cial crisis, the banking and financial system looks safer. But it’s also
evolv ing in ways that are reshaping who provides liquidity, how money moves,
and risks to economic and financial stability. As a result, the next shock
may begin not in a bank, but in the new infrastructure underpinning the system.
 After 2008, regulators moved swiftly to raise
capital standards and introduce new supervisory tools such as stress
testing. Banks rebuilt their bal ance sheets and retreated from risky lending
and arbitrage businesses. Asset managers were blamed for the financial
turmoil at the onset of the pan demic, but not banks.
 Yet even as regulators fortified banks, postcri
sis innovations reshaped the financial landscape.  Asset managers provided
more liquidity as banks stepped back, nonbank start-ups built new risk
assessment tools for institutional lenders, devel opers introduced a wider
array of crypto assets, and central banks and governments established real
time payment systems.
 These developments cut costs, broadened
access, and accelerated transactions. Yet they also caused significant
shifts in the structure of financial intermediation. Liquidity, credit,
and payments—
 the core of the banking system—gravitated toward
asset managers, tech platforms, and decentralized networks.
 This reshaping of finance itself now raises big
questions. What happens when critical finance functions lie outside the
regulatory framework?  How should we ensure stability in a faster, flatter,
and more fragmented financial system?
 From banks to asset managers
Banks were once the protagonists of liquidity cre ation for financial
markets. Yet today, it is non bank asset management funds, not banks, that
contribute a growing share of the system’s day to-day liquidity to households
and investors (Chart 1). Open-end mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs)
let investors redeem money on demand, even though these funds hold assets such
as corporate bonds that are anything but liq uid. They promise daily liquidity
but hold underly ing assets that can’t always be sold—just as banks do,
but without deposit insurance, capital buffers, or access to the central bank.
 This isn’t theory. It’s happening. My research
with Columbia University’s Yiming Ma and Kai rong Xiao shows that bond
mutual funds alone now supply sizable liquidity compared with the entire
banking system, and this share is rising. Yet when markets turn volatile,
mutual funds can be shock amplifiers rather than absorbers. They may be
forced to sell illiquid assets in a falling market, deepening the stress.
 ETFs add complexity. On paper, most ETFs
are passive vehicles. More than 95 percent track an index, such as the S&P 500
or Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index. But in practice, many are surprisingly
active. There are now more ETFs than underlying assets. For many asset classes,
inves tors can choose among plain-vanilla trackers, sec tor-specific funds,
smart beta strategies, and even thematic products like AI-, robotics-, and
green-fo cused ETFs.  Behind the scenes, ETF sponsors must actively manage
portfolios to meet investor flows and keep prices in line with the value of
the underly ing assets. Bond ETF managers frequently deviate from their stated
benchmarks, as my work with Naz Koont of Stanford University, Lubos Pastor
of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and Columbia’s
Ma shows. Bond ETFs, especially, trade like liquid stocks but hold under
lying illiquid bonds. They rely on a network of spe cialized intermediaries,
called authorized partic ipants, to arbitrage price discrepancies between
ETFs and underlying assets.  These participants are also bond dealers and
use the same balance sheets both in their role of managing ETFs and to serve
their trading clients.  When dealer balance sheets get tight, or when bond
markets seize up, ETF arbitrage can break down.  Prices drift, and liquidity
thins. And investors who expected stock-like flexibility may be left holding
something closer to a closed-end fund.
 The new ecosystem of liquidity provision is
more market based, broader, and potentially cheaper than the old one. After
all, bankers face greater constraints in providing daily liquidity, and
asset managers step in to fill the gap. But the new ecosystem plays by a
different rule book, with dif ferent risks when markets freeze.
 AI and big data Lending, once the province of bankers and loan offi
cers, increasingly relies on AI and big data. Non bank fintech platforms

banks often overlook.  Data, in turn, flows more freely between borrow ers and
lenders, training increasingly precise and adaptive machines. My research with
the Indian Institute of Management’s Pulak Ghosh and Har vard’s Boris
Vallee shows how this plays out in India.  Small merchants who rely more
on cashless pay ments with detailed and traceable paper trails get better
access to working-capital loans. They pay lower interest rates and are less
likely to default. In effect, digital footprints are the new credit scores.

 Size is not the only concern. Because Big Tech
sits outside traditional safety nets, traditional cap ital, liquidity, and
resolution rules do not yet apply.  In 2024, Amazon abruptly discontinued its
$140 billion in-house lending program to small busi nesses, illustrating how
platform credit can vanish just when firms need it most. As AI- and data-driven
lending pushes ever more credit through a few dig ital gateways, more
questions crop up alongside the emergence of too-big-to-fail tech monopolies.
 Crypto and instant payments Also at the core of this changing banking
 landscape
is the evolution of payment intermediation. Bitcoin was released in 2008 during
the financial crisis as an alternative form of money for payments. Built on
blockchain technology, Bitcoin aimed to bypass commercial banks and central
banks, offering a decentralized way to move money without relying on trust in
institutions. For good or ill, Bitcoin never fulfilled that promise. It’s
slow to settle, costly to Mutual funds
 Bank deposits Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) use, and highly volatile. For
 most crypto believers,
it is less digital dollar and more digital gold: a specu lative asset,
not functional money.
 Stablecoins, a close cousin of Bitcoin, emerged
to fix this (Chart 2). Like Bitcoin, stablecoins are blockchain assets designed
to provide payment ser vices. New US legislation, including the GENIUS and
STABLE acts, may further boost their growth.  An important difference from
Bitcoin is that stable coins are pegged to real-world currencies, usually
the US dollar. Issuers like Circle (USDC) and Tether (USDT) hold reserves
in bank deposits, Treasury securities, and corporate bonds to maintain
that peg. Avoiding the huge volatility of Bitcoin, stable coins have shown
promise as a cheap and border less payment alternative. Stablecoins have
become lifelines in Argentina, Türkiye, and Venezuela, SEPTEMBER 2025

F&D
 Frontiers of Finance where inflation is high; ordinary people in these
economies now use stablecoins for saving, send ing remittances, and settling
transactions. They are steadily moving into mainstream payment flows as big
banks and giant merchants contemplate issuing their own stablecoins.
 But just like mutual funds and ETFs, stablecoins
lack traditional safeguards such as deposit insur ance and direct access to
central bank support. In March 2023, when Silicon Valley Bank failed, Cir
cle’s USDC temporarily lost its peg after losing access to reserves. The
previous year, the collapse of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin triggered
wide spread losses. My research with Columbia’s Ma and Chicago Booth’s
Anthony Lee Zhang highlights a core dilemma facing stablecoins: The more effec
tively they maintain stable prices, the more they resemble banks—yet without
deposit insurance or a lender of last resort, making them more vulnerable
to runs. These observations make one thing clear: Stablecoins may function
well in good times, but they can falter under stress.  Alongside the rise
of private crypto payment alternatives, government-sponsored fast payment
systems offer a different path. After all, people value speed and efficiency in
payments, yet crypto assets are neither as fast nor as cheap as they claim.
Brazil’s central bank introduced Pix, a fast, free pay “Liquidity,
credit, and payments—the core of the banking system—gravitated toward
asset managers, tech platforms, and decentralized networks.” ment system
built on traditional bank payment rails and always available. It processes
more daily trans actions than cash, credit, and debit cards combined.
More than 90 percent of Brazilian households and businesses have adopted
it. India’s Unified Pay ments Interface followed a similar trajectory (see
“India’s Frictionless Payments” in this issue of F&D).  These systems
deliver what crypto promised—
 faster, more inclusive payments—but in a far less
disruptive way. They have attracted growing inter national attention,
including praise from the Bank FIRSTNAME LAST

 for International Settlements, for promoting finan
cial inclusion while preserving monetary stability.
 Despite the merits, however, fast payment sys
tems come with trade-offs. My new research with the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology’s Ding Ding, the Central Bank of Brazil’s Rodrigo Gonza
lez, and Columbia’s Ma shows that payment sys tems like Pix force banks
to hold more liquid assets to meet unpredictable outflows, reduce bank lend
ing, and—perhaps surprisingly—increase credit risk.  This is because the
convenience of fast payments to consumers comes at the expense of banks’
losses in delaying and netting payment flows. Fast payments increase banks’
need to hold liquid assets such as cash and government bonds over extending
illiquid loans. When banks hold more liquid low-yielding assets, in turn, it
exacerbates their yield-seeking incentives in extending riskier loans. In a
sense, the payment system becomes faster, yet fast payments may inadvertently
make the banking model nar rower and potentially riskier.
 Macro-financial implications Banks are safer thanks to stronger capital
 require
ments, tighter supervision, and regular stress tests.  But we have not
necessarily protected the macro economic environment.

 is more fragmented.
Key functions, payments, credit, and liquidity have shifted outside the
regulatory perimeter. Mutual funds, ETFs, and stablecoins mimic deposits.
Robots and platforms extend credit. But unlike banks, they operate without
deposit insurance, lender-of-last-resort access, or systemic over sight. This,
combined with geoeconomic rivalries, increases the possibility of a more
fragmented f
 inancial system, posing challenges to global regu
latory coordination, as highlighted by the European Central Bank’s Christine
Lagarde and the People’s Bank of China’s Pan Gongsheng. The risks didn’t
vanish. They just moved.
 Second, capital flows have accelerated. Real
time trading, credit-data loops, and fast payments may all amplify shocks. What
once took days now happens in minutes. Yet the tools for absorbing stress,
liquidity backstops, and market interven tions haven’t caught up. The
plumbing is faster, but the stabilizers aren’t.
 Third, the policy toolkit may have gradually
become misaligned. Central banks built their frameworks for a bank-dominated
system in which deposit rates influence lending and lender-of-last resort
facilities calm depositors. But when money resides with asset managers or
as on-chain trans actions or moves through apps, traditional barom eters
are less effective. It’s harder to see where risk builds, and harder to
stop it when it breaks.
 The global financial landscape has changed, yet
the rules remain largely unchanged—and that mis match may be the biggest
risk of all. F&D

data integrity is essential for financial stability T
 echnology is poised to shake up the international
monetary and financial system. How that happens depends on whether technologies
are shaped by the public sector or the private sector sets standards first.
Also at play are regulations, international coopera tion, and the resilience

geoeconomic fragmentation, exchange rate volatility, and the internation

actors use the same platform. But they also could threaten government revenues
and take us back to a 19th century world of private money issuers competing
for seigniorage, which would fragment and destabilize the international
financial system.  Implications of stablecoins
 Stablecoins issued by the private sector bridge the
conventional financial system and the crypto eco system. They promise stable
value relative to fiat currencies, mainly by holding liquid assets such as US
Treasuries, and operate on blockchains. They share some features with money
market funds and with “narrow banking”—also known as 100 per cent
reserve banking—though they typically do not, so far, offer an interest
payment. Almost all BRIAN STAUFFER
 stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, but most
transactions happen outside the United States. Sta blecoins tend to be used as
on- and off-ramps to crypto assets, in which case they are probably vehi cles
for speculative investments. But increasingly, they are also a cross-border
payment instrument.  They are useful where the domestic financial sys tem
is weak or costly to use or when international f
 inancial transactions are regulated, either because
of capital controls or externally imposed sanctions.  In a world where
stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the dollar, become an important
global payment tool, we must brace ourselves for substan tial consequences. On
the negative side are dollar ization and its side effects, financial stability
risks, potential hollowing out of the banking system, cur rency competition
and instability, money launder ing, fiscal base erosion, privatization of
seigniorage, and intense lobbying. On the positive side, cross-bor der payments
may be quicker and cheaper, which matters especially for remittances. And
citizens of countries with poor governance would have access to more stable and
convenient means of payment and store of value than their domestic currency.
Who gets payment data and US dominance when it comes to imposing sanctions
will be affected as well.  Clearly these possibilities warrant more discussion.
 SEPTEMBER 2025 25
F&D
 Frontiers of Finance Capital flows and intermediation US dollar stablecoins
 inherit some characteristics of
their parent, the most important international cur rency. Tied to the
dominant unit of account, they can benefit from the dollar ecosystem’s
network externalities and from its credibility and hence have the potential
to be an important medium of exchange worldwide, facilitating transactions
and remittances. By superseding the system of corre spondent banking and
messaging systems such as SWIFT, they may speed up and lower the costs of
cross-border transactions, improving efficiency.  But some of this decrease in
cost may result from a lack of know-your-customer and anti–money laun dering
compliance—that is, if regulatory authorities do not catch up. Stablecoins
are certainly also an attractive way to get around sanctions and engage in
illegal transactions. They are more stable than Bitcoin and Ether, which
have been used precisely for those purposes (Graf von Luckner, Reinhart,
and Rogoff 2023; Graf von Luckner, Koepke, and Sgherri 2024). Unbacked
crypto assets and stable coins could thus help channel money linked to
illicit or sanctioned activities and substantially erode the tax base of
many countries. Crypto users are likely to find off-ramps to conventional
financial systems in some jurisdictions, offshore or even onshore.
 If the use of US dollar stablecoins increases mas
sively worldwide, it could hollow out banking sec tors because of competition
for deposits. If banks themselves issue stablecoins, it could curb lending
and increase US Treasury holdings—assuming these are the main assets backing
the stablecoins—on the asset side of the balance sheet, a development akin
to narrow banking. The effects on systemic risk, as well as the potential
questionability of some actors’ backing of stablecoins and the ensuing
run risks, bear a close look. And the classic cost of dollariza tion around
the world should be kept in mind: It can alter the transmission channels of
monetary policy and hinder macroeconomic stabilization.  Privatization of
seigniorage For the rest of the world, including Europe, wide adoption
of US dollar stablecoins for payment purposes would be equivalent to the
privatization of seigniorage by global actors. Along with easier f
 lows linked to tax evasion, fiscal accounts could be
affected. On the asset side, the backing of stable coins means that increased
international adoption of those pegged to the dollar could lower demand for
non–US government bonds and raise demand for US Treasuries. The magnitude
of this effect will depend on substitution patterns between dol lar-backed
crypto assets and money market funds and deposits in local currencies and
dollars. Tether “In a world where stablecoins, particularly those pegged to

 and USDC already hold collectively more US Trea
suries than Saudi Arabia, as shown in Chapter 2 of the IMF’s July 2025
External Sector Report. Thus, by increasing the demand for Treasuries and the
stock of US external safe liabilities, US dollar stablecoins could reinforce
the “world banker” balance sheet of the United States and help stabilize
US finances and external deficits. These stablecoins could con stitute a
digital pillar strengthening the exorbitant privilege of the US dollar.
Another consequence of growing US dollar sta blecoin flows, leading to the
privatization of global seigniorage, is significant wealth accumulation by
what is likely, given the strength of network externalities, to be a few
companies and individ uals. From a political economy perspective, this will
usher in increased lobbying for deregulation and opacity of international
capital flows. Such an outcome would defy the public good dimension of the
international monetary system. Unfortunately, data collection efforts on
crypto capital flows by international organizations and country authori
ties are still in their infancy. There are two valuable contributions in
recent IMF research that describe these challenges (Reuter 2025; Cardozo
and oth ers 2024). Since the emergence of cryptocurrencies may threaten core
macroeconomic policies and the f
 inancing and provision of national and global pub
lic goods, measuring their flows, use, and global regulation should be a
policy priority.  Tokenization and integration
 Tokenization could integrate messaging, recon
ciliation, and asset transfer on a unified ledger where central bank digital
currencies (CBDCs) also play a major role. Different countries’ CBDCs
could be linked for efficient cross-border transac tions, according to the
Bank for International Set tlements. Global capital flows could be reshaped 26

 problem is often
ignored. The development of post-quantum cryp tography, secure against both
quantum and classic computers and interoperable with existing com munications
protocols and networks, is progress ing, but the outcome is uncertain given
the race for computer power. Hence the currency networks most exposed to
hacking and to losing their integ rity will see massive confidence crises
and capi tal outflows, which could spur financial crises. In such a world,
the currency network with the small est attack surface for hackers should
harvest a pre mium and reduce its financing costs—this could be called
an “integrity privilege.” To conclude, the impact of technology on the
international monetary and financial system will be profound but is hard
to forecast: It will be shaped by unpredictable innovations, regulatory
policies, and lobbying groups. Major financial stability risks, including
increased volatility in exchange rates; threats to public finances in many
economies; and competition across currency networks are likely. It may
result in large wealth transfers, which will alter the political economy of
regulation. International policy cooperation is therefore essential. Finally,
new technologies  may reshuffle international cur rency dominance and result
in the emergence of an integrity privilege. F&D

bonds, and commod ities could open up access for individual investors,
wherever they are. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms could amplify these
benefits with peer to-peer transactions, cutting out intermediaries such
as banks and brokers. Tokenization may thus expand financial integration,
bringing both advan tages and well-known challenges.  Currencies and financial
stability Such a system could mean more substitutability across currencies
and therefore more competi tion, leading to large portfolio shifts across
cur rency networks. Increasing returns to scale will play out in this larger
international arena, as will forces pushing for a single unit of account;
the incumbent dollar has a head start. But the strategic value of payment
data and the desire for sovereignty in dif ferent jurisdictions’ payment
systems could fuel fragmentation and even restrictions on the use of some
currencies. The emergence of programmable capital controls and granular
restrictions on wal lets is possible, and a more multipolar international
monetary system could follow. The coexistence of multiple connected networks
could even fracture the monetary and financial system if several pri vate
issuers gain market share and tokenization platforms proliferate. But such
a world is inher ently fragile. History tells us that private monies are
unstable for all the traditional reasons linked to lack of credibility. When
they are not well reg ulated and not backed by a sovereign that can tax and
enforce contracts, private monies often lead to runs. Sovereign currencies
themselves may be unstable when the credibility of their institutions—
 in particular, their fiscal institutions—is questioned.
International policy cooperation and regulation are essential to prevent
excessive fragmentation and financial fragility.
 Integrity privilege This new world will risk even greater instability if
loss of credibility also comes from loss of data integ rity. The US Commerce

 D igital innovation often starts with a radi
cal idea. It can be a new way to store and process information, a new business
model, or a new service. But the idea is just the start: Realizing the benefits
of innovation requires hard work, sufficient invest ment, and user adoption.
Disruptive innovation has been the name of the game in the financial sector
over the past decade. New financial technology (fintech) firms have emerged,
large digital platforms (big techs) are offering payment services and credit,
crypto assets and stablecoins are growing in value, and many institutions are
adopting artificial intelli gence. Each of these is challenging traditional f
 inancial intermediaries, like banks, insurers, and
asset managers, and the services that they provide (Ben Naceur and others
2023).  Digital innovations can both complement and substitute for services
in the traditional financial system. Many services seem to offer a stark
alter native to existing intermediaries and services in the 28
 short term. But in the medium term, they often com
plement existing services, leading to even greater competition and a more
diverse financial system.  Still, innovations don’t always lead to the best
out comes on their own: Things can, and frequently do, go wrong. Harnessing the
benefits of digital innova tion often requires forward-thinking public policy.
Disruption in payments Payments are the gateway to financial services. For
individuals, a transaction account is often a prereq uisite for accessing
credit, buying an insurance pol icy, or starting to save and invest. For
new entrants to the financial system, like fintechs and big techs, it is
common to start by handling payments and then branch out into other areas
of finance.  In the past decade, the way we pay has changed dramatically,
with so-called fast or instant payment systems taking off in many countries,
especially emerging markets (see Chart 1). They allow for real time (or
nearly real-time) transfers between end users (Frost and others 2024). Fast,

 Frontiers of Finance are provided by fintechs, big techs, and existing banks.
They use smartphone apps and quick response (QR) codes, even operating on
lower-tech phones. They have generally allowed disruptors to provide services
that directly compete with incumbents.  The most well-known success stories
come from public infrastructures, such as systems operated, or overseen,
by central banks. In Brazil, for instance, the central bank introduced its
fast payment sys tem Pix in November 2020. Now, over 90 percent of Brazilian
adults use the service for daily retail pay ments, such as food or travel,
and even for recurring payments like utility bills. In India, the Unified
Pay ments Interface (UPI)—operated by the National Payments Corporation
of India and regulated by the central bank—promotes services by incumbent
banks, fintechs, and big techs on one platform (see “India’s Frictionless
Payments” in this issue of F&D).  Similar successes include Thailand’s
PromptPay, which is privately run but with a key role for the cen tral bank,
and SINPE Móvil in Costa Rica, operated by the central bank.
 These successful public infrastructures stand in
contrast to the situation in many economies where there are multiple private
sector fast payment sys tems inaccessible to users of other financial
institu tions. For example, in the US, someone using only Venmo cannot
pay someone who uses only Zelle.  Similar “walled gardens” have also
arisen in China, with competing wallets by Alipay and WeChat Pay, and in
Peru, where the wallets Yape and Plin com pete for users (Aurazo and Gasmi
2024). In the case of China and Peru, policy intervention was needed to make
payment systems interoperable.  Often, what begins as a substitute (fintech
and big tech challengers) can complement existing services operating in the
same market. Users get cheaper, faster payments, which can also support f
 inancial resilience and higher economic growth.
The disruptors—and public policy—help improve the system, serve new
clients, offer new services in the same market, and push incumbents to
enhance their offerings.  A digital credit metamorphosis
 Beyond payments comes the need to borrow. Com
panies need credit to make productive investments, and people need it to buy
a house or a car or to pay for education.  In the early days of the fintech
revolution, it looked like new lending platforms could end up replacing many
functions of banks. Crowdlend ing and other new credit platforms grew quickly,
often using alternative data for credit scoring and connecting borrowers
and lenders in streamlined, digital processes. This was soon overshadowed
by new lending by big tech providers, such as mer chant lending by Amazon in
the US and Alibaba in China. The volume of big tech credit boomed (Cornelli
and others 2023).  These new platforms have narrowed gaps in credit markets
and enhanced financial inclusion. In Argentina, for example, Mercado Pago
has stepped in to support small merchants spurned by banks.  In China,
big tech credit has been less sensitive to home prices than bank credit,
potentially reduc ing the importance of collateral. In the US, fintech small
business lenders have targeted areas with high unemployment and bankruptcies,
where banks are less likely to lend. Overall, the impact of fintech and big
tech varies widely from country to country.  But banks are very much still in
the picture, com peting now with a new set of intermediaries. They changed
their business models to look more like platforms, and to use alternative
data. Conversely, many challengers, such as the UK’s Revolut and Brazil’s
Nubank, obtained licenses and became banks themselves.  Crypto and DeFi
 While big techs challenge incumbent financial
institutions at their own game, crypto assets and decentralized finance

possible thanks to an interplay of public sector infrastructures and private
innovation. Proactive steps by public authorities, even in the face of
ini tial reluctance by incumbents, helped improve pay ment services and
financial inclusion, as most nota bly shown with UPI in India and Pix in
Brazil. This helped bring hundreds of millions of people into the financial
system worldwide.  Meanwhile, important risks are emerging from innovation
that could erode financial stability. For instance, shocks from the crypto
sector could spill over to the traditional financial system, poten tially
even posing risks to the US Treasury market (Ahmed and Aldasoro 2025).
To harness the potential of innovation and mit igate the risks, radical new
ideas are necessary, but not sufficient. Also needed are public infrastruc
tures, sound regulation, and practical experimen tation in the public and
private sectors to yield new insights and inform private investment and pub
lic policy. Finally, the public and private sectors need to coordinate to
guide digital technologies toward applications that truly benefit people and
businesses and lay a solid foundation for prosper ity. A recent example of
this type of coordination is Project Agorá, which brings together central
banks and commercial banks to explore a unified ledger to leverage the
benefits of tokenization for cross-bor der payments. F&D

its long history of volatility, mostly for speculative investment purposes,
but also thanks to political support for these assets in some countries.
 Crypto was intended to foster decentralization,
but it hasn’t really turned out that way. Crypto exchanges, traditional
banks, investment funds, and others entering the market mean that the market
remains intermediated and often cen tralized. More important, unbacked crypto
assets often have limited usability because they can be extremely volatile.
Stablecoins, which tie their value to the fiat cur rencies that crypto
ostensibly challenged, emerged as an alternative. The largest stablecoins
are issued by centralized entities that hold assets such as US Treasury
bills and bank deposits to back stablecoins in circulation. But even with
these new intermedi aries, and with the growing presence of stablecoins,
the crypto sector remains riddled with risks, includ ing widespread fraud,
scams, money laundering, and terrorism financing. In addition, stablecoins
fall short of providing necessary elasticity in the monetary system. Because
more than 98 percent of stablecoins by value are tied to the US dollar,
they can also undermine monetary sovereignty in many jurisdictions.
 Still, crypto and stablecoins provide a glimpse of
functionality that may have broader applicability. For example, programmability
and tokenization could improve existing functions and enable new ones
within the existing monetary system, based on central banks at the core and
commercial banks interacting with clients. In cross-border payments, for
example, tokenization could rewire the correspondent banking system, allowing
for messaging, reconciliation, and asset transfer in a single action. New
functions like simultaneous (“atomic”) settlement and enhanced collateral
management could dramatically improve the functioning of capital markets. These
functions could lay the foundation for a future tokenized finan cial system.
 Public policy to guide innovation
These radical innovations have significantly changed the financial system over
the past decade.  Stark challenges that threatened to substitute for existing
services have often evolved into something new that is complementary to those
services—fre quently fostering competition. And by and large, this has
helped lower consumer prices and made services more efficient. But innovation
may not always lead to the best outcomes on its own.  Forward-looking public
policies allowed for some of the biggest, most impactful breakthroughs.

 crime doesn’t have to come at the cost of privacy L egend has it that
 gangster Al Capone hid
the illicit origins of his wealth by using laundromats as a front. Ever
since, author ities have worked to track and seize “laun dered” money
from criminals and, more recently, terrorists.  These efforts are even
trickier today because of digital assets such as stablecoins, which can be
washed through many accounts beyond the reach of law enforcement. But the
need to stop bad actors must not trammel the privacy rights of law-abiding
people nor the efficient processing of billions of dol lars in payments and
transfers every day.
 These goals may seem unreachable, but we
argue that technology may actually make this objective feasible.
“Smart-compliant” payment systems that fight 32
 crime, protect privacy, and work efficiently are
within reach. These systems can be built directly into the blockchains of
stablecoins—digital assets pegged to traditional money.  How would this
work in practice? Say Alice wants to pay Bob. Once she taps “send” in
her phone app, previous verification of their identi ties is confirmed, the
transaction is reviewed by a decentralized algorithm for suspicious activity,
and the operation is completed—all on a block chain. Flagged transactions
would automatically be reported to law enforcement. The identities of Alice
and Bob, however, could be unmasked only with a warrant or through another
legal process.
 With anticipated advances in technology, this
compliance-by-design vision could become a prac tical reality for large-scale
payment systems.  SEPTEMBER 2025

 Frontiers of Finance Balancing privacy and transparency New attempts at
 regulating blockchain-based
f
 inance do not resolve the fundamental tension
between the protection of privacy and legal com pliance. In payment systems,
compliance and pri vacy are traditionally competing forces. Stablecoin
payment systems exemplify this tension. But they may also offer a natural
compromise since their decentralized and programmable architecture allows
compliance mechanisms to be built in, and their pseudonymity helps keep
privacy risks low.  This article explains how a “compliance-by-de sign”
approach (Duffie, Olowookere, and Veneris 2025) could make it possible for
decentralized stablecoin payment systems to protect privacy and enforce
anti–money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism
(CFT) reg ulations and sanctions. Compliance enforcement would take place
as transactions occur, based on predefined criteria and risk indicators,
instead of reactively, as is the case today. This approach is in line with
the 2023 IMF–Financial Stability Board policy framework for crypto assets,
which calls for compliance measures for stablecoin providers.  In such
an environment, stablecoin users are likely to split into two groups. If
institutions and individuals value both compliance and confiden tiality,
they are likely to select a compliance-by-de sign payment network. Others
may continue using legacy approaches to stablecoin payments that are based
on pseudonymity and relatively loose com pliance constraints.
 Before going deeper, let’s define privacy inter
ests in the context of stablecoin payments. For individuals, a major concern
is the protection of personal information, including names, home addresses,
and phone numbers. For corporations and institutions, privacy concerns
may include transaction metadata—such as amounts, time stamps, patterns,
and counterparties—which may be commercially sensitive. For businesses,
main taining confidentiality is not only strategically important, it is
often also a legal requirement.
 Compliance involves know-your-customer
(KYC) standards and monitoring of payments for illegal activity. Currently,
stablecoin providers del egate compliance tasks to centralized exchanges
and other custodians that provide on-ramps and off-ramps for conversion
between stablecoins and traditional currencies.  However, the ability to
mint stablecoins and move them between multiple accounts with decen tralized
protocols, and the availability of “mixers” that obscure the trail of
any single coin, makes it rel atively easy to obscure transactions. Law
enforce ment has limited reach and is often reactive, trig gered only after
suspicious activity is detected. As a result, compliance with AML, CFT,
and sanctions frameworks is relatively ineffective. Moreover, compliant
users’ privacy is limited because pay ments are publicly observable and
transparently linked to the user’s pseudonym.
 Reconciling privacy standards with regulatory
compliance calls for a model that better protects user data while reasonably
enforcing the law.  This requires a way to verify identities without
exposing them.  Verification without exposure
 In a compliance-by-design decentralized payment
system, before Alice can pay Bob, both must have undergone identity
verification by a licensed pro vider of such services (subsequently referred
to as a credential issuer), as illustrated in Chart 1. Verifica tion places
Alice and Bob within the KYC perimeter of their chosen decentralized payment
system. This verification is stored on the payment-system ledger as a
“hashed” (cryptographically masked) certificate.
 At this point, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)
come into play. These are cryptographic tools that can be implemented in a
multiuser software plat form, allowing a user to prove something without
revealing what that something is. For example, a ZKP can establish which
poker hand wins without revealing the cards of that player.  Likewise,
ZKPs can allow users of a decentral ized payment system to demonstrate
know-your customer compliance without revealing their personal data. It
works by ensuring that each trans action that users initiate includes
a ZKP proof of their eligibility to be inside the KYC perimeter of the
payment system—without revealing their iden tity or any other underlying
personal information.  This approach could be used in any decentral ized
payment system, in particular a system based on stablecoins. In principle,
the same approach could be applied to decentralized payment sys tems based
on central bank digital currencies and other digital representations of money.
 Privacy is preserved unless specific risk indica
tors, such as unusual transaction patterns, trans fers exceeding designated
thresholds, or links to known high-risk wallets, are detected. Smart con

ules that enforce agreements on the ledger network without needing a

regulatory authorities. Access by the authorities to underlying sensitive

certi cate from an authorized service provider.
 F&D Stablecoin KYC perimeter known offenders may be blocked. These responses
are enforced through smart contracts that can be dynamically updated to
reflect evolving regulatory priorities, special cases, and insights obtained
from the statistical analysis of payment patterns.
 The KYC credential maintained by issuers
secures databases of validated user credentials and allows them to be
updated or revoked when compromised. If Alice’s legal status changes—for
example, as a result of  a sanction—her compliance proof would fail and
her transactions within the KYC perimeter would be blocked.
 The stablecoin payment system we have
described replaces time-consuming “off-chain” manual reactive
reviews—common practice today—with proactive real-time “on-chain”
algo rithmic supervision. By leveraging smart contracts to apply compliance
rules as transactions occur, this framework taps directly into the strengths
of blockchain systems.
 Implementation The KYC perimeter could be implemented using
zero-knowledge KYCs (zkKYCs) (Pauwels 2021), which combine zero-knowledge
proofs with selec tive disclosure. For example, Alice can prove that she
meets specific identity checks (like being over 18) without revealing her
age. Under this approach, a government agency or authorized financial insti
tution issues Alice a verifiable credential derived from her official or
government-issued identity documentation. A cryptographically protected
version of this credential is stored in each user’s private digital wallet.
 During a transaction, a zkKYC token generated
from this credential is embedded on-chain. This token proves KYC compliance
without revealing user identities, and the underlying credentials remain
securely off-chain with the credential issuer.  For payments by natural
persons, such as peer-to peer or customer-to-business payments, identity
spoofing can be mitigated by anchoring verifiable credentials to standardized
legal documents such as passports or driver’s licenses.
 For example, when Alice initiates a payment to
Bob, her wallet generates a zkKYC token that cryp tographically proves that
Alice has a verifiable cre dential. The token confirms that Alice has under ID

institution and confirms the transaction amount, wallet thresholds, and other
relevant data. This token need not reveal Alice’s identity or transaction
details to Bob or any third party unless Alice agrees, or unless a SAR is
trig gered and a legal basis for disclosure is established.
 Automated compliance enforcement relies on
ledger-embedded smart contracts that analyze encrypted information contained
in zkKYC tokens for a match with specified SAR criteria. If a match is found,
the contract automatically generates a SAR, allowing enforcement without

 Compliance by design offers a promising path for
ward but is not a silver bullet. The approach we have outlined involves a

ance checks, overwhelming enforcement authori ties with noise and risking
exploitation by bad actors.
 Another challenge is the computational cost of pri
vacy-preserving mechanisms, risking delays during peak-payment
periods. Compliance-by-design pay ment systems may also add frictional costs
and delays to moving funds between different payment systems.  One solution
to the computational burden problem would be to allow regulated providers to
license and manage smart contracts, providing compliance as a service. With
this setup, users could grant limited access to their payment data in exchange
for compliance services and other bene f
 its, mirroring how privacy and consumer risk are
managed by private firms today.
 Further, as applied cryptography remains a
fast-evolving field, new zero-knowledge-proof implementation promises to be
faster. And new techniques, like multiparty computation, may help with the
computational burden of administering smart contracts.  The road ahead
 The compliance-by-design model presented here
relies on sound governance. Establishing a trusted ecosystem of credential
issuers is critical. Creden tial issuers and smart contract operators
must be carefully licensed and must operate transparently and with
accountability. Governments, banks, and certified financial technology
firms could be the trusted nodes that anchor users to the compliance
perimeter. Trusted credential issuers must follow uniform standards for KYC
verification, and their verification should be interoperable across multi
ple ledgers. As with conventional payment systems, system-wide compliance
quality hinges on the least rigorous credential issuers.  Laws may need to
be adapted or applied in new ways. What justifies triggering a SAR? Under
what conditions may authorities unmask a user’s iden tity? Different
jurisdictions would likely set distinct due-process thresholds. One country
might require only administrative subpoenas while another demands judicial
warrants.  Effective cross-border enforcement of com pliance relies on
cross-jurisdictional cooperation, as is true of conventional correspondent
banking today. For example, Project Mandala is a proposal by the Bank for
International Settlements for a compliance-by-design approach to coordinating
compliance checks by banks and other financial institutions involved in
cross-border payments.  Analogous to the stablecoin compliance-by-design
approach we have described, Project Mandala uses zero-knowledge proofs to
establish the validity of a bank’s compliance statement without the need
to share that bank’s compliance-related data with other banks involved in
the payment.  We do not propose that stablecoin payment sys tems be required
to adopt a compliance-by-design approach. In fact, even if some countries were
to impose this approach as a regulatory requirement, it would be challenging
to block domestic access to alternative offshore stablecoin systems that do
not take this approach to privacy and compliance.
 Stablecoins hold significant promise for improv
ing financial inclusion and the efficiency of payment systems—and making
life harder on modern-day Al Capones. But they need to reach a much better
bal ance between privacy and compliance. The compli ance-by-design approach
we have outlined is one way to do that. F&D

 I Frontiers of Finance Optimus: That is clearly defined in the laws and reg
ulations of each country. Depending on the specific magine three friends
meeting in the Roman forum.  One is optimistic about technology, one skepti
cal, and one is after the bigger picture. They start debating the role of
money shaped by innovations such as stablecoins, tokenized deposits, central
bank digital currency (CBDC), and digital finan cial infrastructure. In a
world laced with uncertainty, dialogue is paramount. Let’s listen in.
 Optimus: Skeptimus, I just discovered an amazing
new way to pay for things. From my phone, I can transfer money to anyone
in the world. It’s instant, cheap, and easy. To receive funds, just
print a QR code or share a number. Even merchants can sign up. It’s
called a stablecoin.  Skeptimus: Oh, Optimus, there you go again. It’s
just another money-transfer app.  Optimus: No, no, no. You can also hold
a balance in stablecoins. You don’t need a separate bank account. The
stablecoin is the bank.  Skeptimus: It’s not a bank! Banks have vaults,
they have offices, they insure deposits, they… Optimus: OK, you’re right,
it’s not a bank. But for good reason. Banks offer package deals. They issue
money—our deposits. At the front end, they onboard customers and merchants,
and build e-banking apps. At the back end, they run data bases to track our
money, message other banks to transfer funds, and offer services like fraud
detec tion. Full service.  Skeptimus: So? I like my bank. I like paying
by card.  And banks are exploring tokenized deposits.  Optimus: Right,
millions are like you. Stablecoin companies are a little different. They
focus on pro viding a payment instrument—denominated in dol lars,
euros, yen, and potentially other currencies.  They mostly leave front-
and back-end services to others. Stablecoins are recorded and transferred
on blockchains. And separate digital wallet providers take on customers and
build apps. That frees up each firm in the chain to be more innovative. Of
course, banks and asset managers are no bystand ers. They too are exploring
ways to make their deposits and other assets available on blockchains.
 Skeptimus: What about fraud detection and ensur
ing transactions don’t fund terrorists?  regulations, various financial
companies, including stablecoin providers, are required to “know their
customer” and check for money laundering and criminal activity.  Skeptimus:
OK, but what’s in it for users?
 Optimus: Stablecoin companies have racked up mil
lions of users globally, transacting across borders around the clock at fairly
low cost, and they can scale up. That was barely possible even five years
ago.  Skeptimus: I see the creative energy, the growth potential, the extra
competition—it’s all good. Still, stablecoins remain small. They’re
mostly used to buy crypto assets like Bitcoin—they’re the payment
instruments of the blockchain world.  Optimus: True, but they could be used
in retail pay ments if integrated into popular phone apps. They could be
used for e-commerce, for cross-border transactions, to buy securities on
blockchains.  Money market funds and asset managers are start ing to offer
investment products, like exchange traded funds, on blockchains. And banks are
exploring ways to make their deposits transferable on the same infrastructure.
Skeptimus: But are stablecoins safe?
 Optimus: Well, the value of stablecoins fluctuates with
the value of the assets held by the issuer as reserves.  And that has motivated
policymakers to phase in laws and regulations to make stablecoins safer.
Previous page: The Temple of Saturn in the Roman Forum.
 Stability Skeptimus: That’s a good start, but just the first step.
Is regulation sound? Will supervision be strict? Will enforcement curb
dubious activity?
 Optimus: Why not? Stablecoin companies want to
be regulated and trusted.
 Skeptimus: Not all. Some may try to appeal to bad
actors by offering anonymity.  Optimus: Those shouldn’t even be allowed
to issue.  They wouldn’t meet regulatory requirements.  Skeptimus: Ah, but
will users be able to distinguish stablecoins targeting a fixed value in, say,
dollars or euros from those intended to represent riskier assets? The second
type should certainly not be considered money—whether most people would 38

 F&D accept the first as money “no questions asked” is
also debatable.  Optimus: Skeptimus, you underestimate my ability to tell
good from bad!  Skeptimus: Sorry, don’t take it wrong. Still, even for
you, I see a risk. There have always been runs on private money. As you
said earlier, the more sta ble the reserve assets, the more stable the
stable coins. Treasury bills are good backing assets. But even their prices
vary as interest rates move. When prices decrease too much, users might run
from stablecoins—especially if they question the exact assets being held.
Optimus: Even bank deposits are risky, as not all of them are insured. And
stablecoin issuers can hold extra capital as a backup. Or what about holding
even safer and more liquid assets, like central bank reserves?  Skeptimus:
Yes, that would be safer. But central banks may not want to be involved,
or to immobi lize their reserves.  Currency risks
 Vastus: Friends, sit down and cast your eyes on the
horizon. I see two more risks. Even if stablecoins are safe and convenient—as
you say, Optimus—cit izens of countries with high inflation, weak curren
cies, or poor payment systems will jump on them.  Finally, an accessible
dollar. Individually, people may be better off. Collectively, they could drain
deposits from their banks and undermine the abil ity of their central bank
to conduct monetary policy and stabilize the financial system. What’s the
point of setting interest rates on a currency no one uses?  Will stablecoins
spell the end of weaker currencies?
 Optimus: You’re right, that is a problem. Then
again, countries could require stablecoins to be held in domestically regulated
wallets with limits on holdings.  Skeptimus: Easier said than done. People
can hide their computer’s location; enforcement is hard in a borderless
market.  Optimus: True, but technology is both cat and mouse, Skeptimus. It
could help enforce, not just avoid, limits. Of course, stablecoin issuers
would need to cooperate with country authorities.  Vastus: Another risk is
fragmentation—the difficulty of exchanging one stablecoin for another form
of money or with another stablecoin. Say you hold Sta blecoin A, Optimus, and
Skeptimus holds Stable coin B. Optimus, how do you pay Skeptimus?  Optimus:
Click and go… Vastus: Not so easy. Skeptimus doesn’t trust coin A. He
only wants B. And you can’t just convert A to B, as A may be backed by
a different pool of assets—perhaps because it’s regulated differently
in another country. Or suppose A is recorded on one blockchain and B on
another, and the two are not compatible. There are solutions, but they’re
clunky and costly. Or perhaps you convince Skeptimus to hold coin A after
all. But then you have an antitrust problem—everyone holding the same coin.
Central bank reserves
 Optimus: Banks solved this problem long ago. Each
holds some central bank reserves—a common, safe asset—and when one pays
the other it transfers reserves over the central bank’s payment system.
Why can’t stablecoins do the same?
 Vastus: In that case, we’re coming back full cir
cle to central bank digital currency. If central bank reserves were available
to stablecoin issu ers within the day, just for payments, they could ensure
interoperability, as Optimus says. Maybe in exchange for some additional
oversight by the cen tral bank. Fully backing stablecoins with reserves is
a different possibility. It’s but a small step away from fully exchanging
stablecoins for CBDC.  Optimus: What? You’d do away with all the inno
vation and customer connections that stablecoin companies have built?
 Vastus: Not quite. Keep the talent, the innova
tion, the new services. Just do away with the creation of money. Leave that
to central banks, which know how to do it safely. But allow private f
 irms to invent ways to distribute the money, to
transact efficiently, to build financial services.  Instead of obsessing
about the killer application for CBDC, and putting that on the shoulders
of central banks, give wings to the private sector to innovate—safely and
passionately. It’s a dif ferent approach—CBDC built for integration and
innovation.  Optimus: That’s my kind of optimism!  Skeptimus: It won’t
work. Without a balance sheet, or revenue from holding assets like Treasuries,
sta blecoin companies will close.  SEPTEMBER 2025

F&D
 Frontiers of Finance Optimus: Not necessarily. They’re already rebating
most of their revenue to users through incentives, and competition will augment
that. Plus, they’d need to find other revenue sources when Treasury yields
approach zero in downturns. They’ll figure it out. And central banks could
provide incentives to foster innovation.  Skeptimus: To grease the wheels
of private firms, you mean… The money road
 Vastus: Now, now—we’re just speculating. Money
doesn’t exist in a vacuum; except for cash, it is recorded on ledgers,
the roads on which money travels. Roads have held together empires! Infra
structure matters.  Optimus: Blockchains are the new roads, Vas tus. They
are the ledgers on which stablecoins are recorded and transacted. And they
can also record securities—any asset, really. When money and securities
are on the same blockchain, you can pay for a security at exactly the time
you receive it, lowering risks of remaining without either. It’s also
easier to automate, you can trade around the clock and across borders,
and you don’t need so many costly intermediaries.
 Vastus: That assumes proper legal and regulatory
foundations, which are still being hashed out.  Hopefully these will be
consistent across countries.
 Skeptimus: The real risk is concentration. If a single
blockchain offers so many advantages, will we end up with a massive national
or regional blockchain recording all assets? Would a dominant stablecoin
favor one blockchain, then impose its standards on everyone else?
 Optimus: Stablecoins are independent of infrastruc
ture. But plans may change. The same stablecoin can be reissued on different
blockchains.  Skeptimus: That may be the future, though jumping chains
is expensive and risky. That’s where cyber criminals lurk. Then again,
stablecoins aside, com petition among blockchains is healthy, and diver sity
helps. One chain may be better for privacy, another for programmability, and
a third for speed.  Vastus: The trick is compatibility. Code written for one
chain—to establish ownership, swap assets, or check identities—should run
on another chain.  Compatibility alleviates the problems of concen tration
and fragmentation.  Skeptimus: Maybe there’s a role for the public sector:
to vet the stability and compatibility of blockchains and contracts written
for them?
 Optimus: Actually, I’d go one step further. If cen
tral bank money is needed on-chain to settle trans actions for everyone’s
peace of mind, then central banks can be a catalyst for one blockchain
standard over another. Everyone will want to be compatible with the central
bank. Meanwhile, innovation can still happen on external, yet compatible,
chains.  Skeptimus: Easier said than done. But that’s the direction some
central banks are exploring. Things are moving fast.  Optimus: Here’s
another idea, perhaps far-fetched, to avoid the downsides of concentration
but still have a single, or few, blockchains and sufficient innova tion:
open-source code and decentralized ownership.  Thousands of programmers
innovating and propos ing new features, and thousands of computers run ning
the blockchain. No single entity in control but still seamless exchange
of assets. And no one has to pay billions to develop their own blockchain.
Skeptimus: I would never hold an asset on a block chain without a customer
service number to call.  Forget it. And what arrangements govern a decen
tralized community, even if well intentioned?
 Optimus: Governance is an issue, so is privacy, but
solutions are emerging. We must think differently.  The phone number will be
that of your wallet, of your broker, or the asset issuer. They could con trol
the assets and take responsibility. Transaction rules could be hard-coded
into the asset itself and automatically enforced. That way everyone could
potentially transact; whether they’re allowed to is another story.  Vastus:
Optimus, you force us to look ahead. But perhaps too far, or too fast. We’re
talking about per sonal wealth, financial stability, institutional credi
bility. We may eventually get to where you gaze, or elsewhere. Do me a favor,
walk hand in hand with Skeptimus. Together, you’ll find the right pace
and course of change.  Skeptimus: Wise words, Vastus.  Optimus: And yet,
we must move… F&D

FRICTIONLESS PAYMENTS Alex Copestake, Divya Kirti, and María Soledad
Martínez Pería Y
 ou’re in line at a café. When you reach the
counter, you tap your phone to pay—only to be told, “Sorry, we only take
Apple Pay.  You’re trying to use Google Pay.” You sigh and leave without
your coffee.
 This minor frustration reveals a major chal
lenge: Digital payments are not always as con venient as they sound. As is
often the case with infrastructure—digital or physical—we notice only
when it doesn’t work well. What’s missing here is interoperability: the
ability of different payment apps, banks, and platforms to connect seamlessly.
 Many digital payment systems are like walled gar
dens. If you and the person you are paying do not use the same payment
provider, the transaction is not possible. Private platforms prefer to keep
users within their domains, also known as closed-loop systems.
 Interoperability turns walled gardens into public
squares, where everyone can transact with anyone.  You use your favorite app,
and the other party uses theirs—and the payment goes through.
 Our recent research shows that this freedom of
choice drives two major benefits (Copestake and others 2025). The first is a
better user experience.  Consumers choose their favorite apps based on what
they value, including ease of use, reliability, or language options. The
second is more innovation.  Providers must consistently deliver and improve,
since switching is easy, and users are not locked in.
 Digital acceleration Our work draws on India’s rapid transition to dig
ital payments and finds that interoperability can empower consumers, foster
innovation, and accel erate the shift away from cash.  In 2016, the country
launched the Unified Pay ments Interface (UPI), which allows payments to
be sent and received easily across all participating apps and banks. The
system has transformed India’s pay ment landscape and become the largest
real-time payment system in the world by volume, process ing more than 19
billion transactions every month.  Tellingly, most UPI transactions take place
across different apps, which would not be possible if they operated only as
closed-loop systems. At the same time, cash use has declined. UPI’s is a
story of digital acceleration unlocked by interoperability.
 Many users initially joined UPI through trusted
apps, often offered by their banks. The UPI opera tor also launched BHIM,
a simple public app to help introduce the system to new users.
 As UPI gained traction, more than 200 apps and
most banks entered the market. And interopera bility allowed users to move
freely to newer, better apps—without having to persuade other users to
shift at the same time.
 The world’s
largest real time payment system shows the power of interoperable platforms
This flexibility meant new entrants could both enter more easily and scale up
more quickly.  Incumbents had to raise their game. More reli able apps—as
measured by transaction failure rates—pulled in more users. Over time,
reliabil ity improved across the board.
 Driving growth But was interoperability critical to the digital pay
ment takeoff, or would it have happened anyway?  Evidence from two important
episodes using new, granular data reveals that interoperability did indeed
play a central role in driving the growth of digital payments in India.
 First, India’s banknote demonetization in
2016 (when the government withdrew vari ous banknote denominations from
circulation) pushed many people to try digital payments for the first
time. Users faced a choice between closed-loop apps and the interoperable
UPI. They largely chose UPI, which saw much more rapid growth—driven by
cross-app transactions made possible by interoperability.  Second, in 2017,
after a regulatory push, a lead ing closed-loop provider joined UPI, resulting
in the merger of two large preexisting payment net works. The result? In
districts with the most initial fragmentation—and therefore the largest
gains from this increase in interoperability—digital pay ments grew faster.
Users valued the combined network more than the sum of its parts: Both networks
were used more, and transactions between them also picked SEPTEMBER 2025

F&D
 Frontiers of Finance up. Total digital payments rose relative to proxies
for cash usage.
 Connected networks Interoperability was a key driver of India’s success
in expanding digital payments. But several other factors contributed as
well. These include a broad digital ID system, financial inclusion programs,
and affordable mobile internet.  Countries seeking to expand digital
payments can draw several lessons from India’s experience. It starts
with building open infrastructure. Interoper ability can foster user choice
and innovation. Next, invest in digital enablers. Affordable mobile data,
national ID systems, and broad access to banking are essential. Governments
can also support early adop tion with a public app that helps build momentum.
 It’s also crucial to monitor the market and tai
lor regulation. In India, providers have found ways to nudge users—through
QR code branding, bun dled services, and other means—to stay within their
walled gardens. Today, over 95 percent of UPI transactions are initiated
using only three apps, and in about half of them, both payer and payee use
the same app. Tracking usage patterns, app dominance, and switching costs
is critical for authorities to iden tify the best ways to preserve user choice.
 Back to the café. This time, you can use your
preferred provider, pay instantly, and walk away with your coffee and a
digital receipt. That small moment of ease—made possible by interoperability
“India’s UPI is the largest real-time payment system in the world by
volume, with more than 19 billion transactions a month.” —is the foundation
of a broader digital transforma tion. It is what allows digital systems to
reach every one on their terms, without creating new silos.  Done right,
interoperability turns fragmented sys tems into connected networks. It
strengthens trust, accelerates adoption, and levels the playing field. For
countries building the future of finance, interopera bility is not just
helpful, it’s fundamental. F&D

ASIA’S CROSS BORDER PAYMENT PUSH
 Nadine Freischlad A t the edge of Bali’s Pura Tanah Lot, an
ancient Hindu temple that towers above the ocean atop an outcrop of rocks
on the Indonesian island’s southwestern coast, a row of souvenir stalls
invites tourists to shop for artwork, bracelets, sarongs, and other wares.
 A $2 pair of sunglasses catches a shopper’s eye.
A buyer can use a mobile wallet app to scan a QR code: a faded black-and-white
printout taped to a glass counter at the back of the stall. After keying
in the amount and showing the stall owner the trans action confirmation
screen, the sale is complete. No cash changes hands; no cards are swiped.
Seamless QR code payments are common across Southeast Asia. Mass adoption
occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, when govern ments urged merchants to
move away from cash.  These payments are convenient for customers and much
simpler and cheaper for small businesses than a formal card-reading device.
 QRIS, Indonesia’s national QR code standard,
established by the central bank and payment asso ciation in 2019, does
not charge small businesses for processing payments below 500,000 rupiah
($30). Settlement is instant. Transactions above this threshold cost just
0.3 percent.
 But there’s a problem: QRIS transactions are still
limited mostly to domestic use. With a mobile wal let from outside Indonesia,
the sunglasses payment probably wouldn’t have gone through.  Domestic instant
payment systems were trans formative for Southeast Asia, but regulators
and businesses then “started to recognize the oppor tunity of connecting
them,” says Benjamin Lee, interim director of Singapore-based Nexus Global
Payments (NGP), a nonprofit established by several central banks in April
2025 to improve cross-border connectivity.
 On one hand, there’s a growing number of
bilateral links. Thailand and Singapore were the f
 irst to establish one, in 2021, linking their instant
payment systems. Others, such as Singapore and India, Thailand and Malaysia,
followed. Indone sia recently announced plans for a QR code link beyond the
region, with China and Japan. On the other hand, there’s an ongoing effort,
spearheaded by NGP, to create infrastructure for multilateral connections
to allow all manner of cross-border instant payments through a shared node
and a common system.  Mobile payment innovation
 After a decade of rapid digitalization, and inspired by
China and India, Southeast Asia is pushing forward with mobile payment
innovation. Smartphone adop tion soared after 2010 and, with it, proliferation
of Policymakers want seamless digital transfers between countries to be
obstacle-free
 digital platforms for rides, meals, and e-commerce,
fueled by billions of dollars in venture capital.  But there was one major
source of friction: pay ments. Card usage, especially credit cards, is low in
Southeast Asia. This made it difficult to provide a secure environment for
online transactions. And only a fraction of offline merchants had the means
to install card readers. Most small-scale daily trans actions used cash,
even in major cities.
 Digital platforms needed a better way to move
money—not just between consumers and mer chants, but within their own
ecosystems of drivers, couriers, and sellers. If most ride-hailing drivers
received cash from passengers, there was no easy way for the platforms to
take a cut.
 Digital wallets, such as those pioneered by Alib
aba in China and Paytm in India, emerged as a solu tion for Southeast
Asia. They allowed users to store money on their phones, making it easy to
pay for rides, meals, or online orders without handling cash.
 At first, each platform built its own closed-loop
system. Payments worked smoothly inside the app and between its
partners. This was efficient for plat forms but fragmented for consumers
and mer chants. Regulators soon recognized the need for open, standardized
infrastructure that would allow digital payments across platforms and
providers.  Consolidation and standardization
 Singapore pioneered this push. In 2017, its bank
ing association introduced PayNow, an instant pay ing association introduced

 Frontiers of Finance ment system (IPS) for peer-to-peer transfers. The
aim, according to Kenneth Gay, chief fintech offi cer at the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS),
 was to “provide a safe, simple, and faster way for
individuals and businesses in Singapore to make payment transactions.”
 Similar to India’s Unified Payments Interface
(UPI), PayNow enables the electronic transfer of money to people using only
their mobile phone or national ID numbers, and to businesses using their
unique entity numbers—in real time, 24/7, for free.
 Singapore also expanded its existing Network
for Electronic Transfers (NETS) to support QR code payments at regular
offline stores. Together, these systems created a more open, connected payment
landscape—one that didn’t rely solely on cards or proprietary wallets.
 Other countries followed. Malaysia introduced
DuitNow and Thailand PromptPay, which both fol low a similar approach
to Singapore’s and support UPI-style transfers; Indonesia introduced
BI-FAST and QRIS. They all aim to unify domestic payments under national
standards and establish public infra structure that private fintech firms
can use. But, says Gay, “Most cross-border payments remained slow, opaque,
and inefficient, due to their reliance on mul tiple correspondent banks and
other intermediaries.” Formally linking national instant payment sys tems
across countries would eliminate fragmenta tion and, according to MAS, “carry
over the benefits of cheap, fast, seamless payments from the domes tic to the
cross-border arena.” Travelers and the many merchants that cater to them
would appre ciate the convenience of interoperability among standardized
national QR code systems.  Allowing international fund transfers using a
mobile phone or ID number via linked IPSs would be even more transformative,
and a boon for the many families that rely on remittances from rela tives
working elsewhere in the region.

 eral links is too resource-intensive. “Each linkage
required a refresh in technical alignment between the respective two IPSs and
alignment in domes tic policies and requirements, such as on data privacy,
security, and sanctions screening,” says Gay. It took three years of
extensive collaboration between multiple stakeholders to finalize the 2021
PayNow–PromptPay linkage.
 Expanding IPS links to a broader network of
countries becomes more efficient with a multilat eral payment gateway
solution—which is why cen tral banks and regulators came together to form
NGP, a gateway designed to standardize the way domestic IPSs connect to
one another.
 “The Project Nexus idea was originally conceived
at the Singapore Innovation Hub,” says Lee, referring to a Bank for
International Settlements initiative that promotes new technologies for
safer, faster, and more connected financial systems. Rather than building
custom connections for every new country, an IPS operator need make only one
connection to Nexus to As with bilateral linkages, tapping into a sin gle
node through Nexus requires common tech nical standards, including common
operating standards and processes that cover approaches to data privacy
and money laundering safeguards, and a consistent commercial model that
protects the interests of all stakeholders.  There’s real momentum now, says
Lee. “The region came together about two years ago, under the Indonesian
G20 presidency, when the idea of regional payments connectivity was made a
prior ity, and has now led to the establishment of NGP and a shared desire
to scale this network globally to other interested and ready jurisdictions.”
 NGP is now focused on foundational work to
build its capabilities and enable Nexus to go live. It is expected to appoint
a technical operator to build and operate the network this year, according to
MAS’s Gay. “We expect to see the first live cross-border transaction on
Nexus around 2027,” he said, before expanding to other interested countries.
 Glimpse of the future Large-scale adoption of cross-border functionality
depends on sustained collaboration between gov ernments, central banks,
and fintech players. Smaller banks too need to raise their game or risk
being left behind amid rapid payment industry transformation.  Many banks
in Southeast Asia still “operate on legacy systems,” says Arun Kini,
managing director for Asia-Pacific payments at fintech firm Finastra,
which specializes in helping banks meet the latest technical and regulatory
requirements.  Banks can benefit from tapping into burgeoning IPSs, but their
popularity has also “become a bot tleneck for the banks,” posing problems
for those that don’t have the technology to tap into them, says Kini.
 So while there’s progress, NGP’s vision of a
cross-border payment landscape in which peo ple, banks, and fintech firms can
effortlessly move money to each other across borders may take time.  In the
meantime, innovative technology is still pop ping up to meet everyday needs.

TECH-FUELED CRIME
 Chady El Khoury T he Department of Justice in June
announced the largest-ever US crypto seizure: $225 million from crypto scams
known as pig butchering, in which orga nized criminals, often across borders,
use advanced technology and social engineering such as romance or investment
schemes to manipulate victims. This typically involves using AI-generated
profiles, encrypted messaging, and obscured block chain transactions to hide
and move stolen funds.  It was a big win. Federal agents collaborated across
jurisdictions and used blockchain analysis and machine learning to track
thousands of wal lets used to scam more than 400 victims. Yet it was also
a rare victory that underscored how authorities often must play catch-up
in a fast-changing digital world. And the scammers are still out there.
Criminals are outpacing enforcement by adapt ing ever faster. They pick
the best tools for their schemes, from laundering money through crypto and
AI-enabled impersonation to producing deep fake content, encrypted apps,
and decentralized exchanges. Authorities confronting anonymous, borderless
threats are held back by jurisdiction, pro cess, and legacy systems.
Annual illicit crypto activity growth has aver aged about 25 percent in
recent years and may have surpassed $51 billion last year, according to
Chain alysis, a New York–based blockchain analysis firm specializing in
helping criminal investigators trace transactions.
 Bad actors still depend on cash and traditional
f
 inance, and money laundering specifically relies on
banks, informal money changers, and cash couriers.  But the old ways are
being reinforced or supercharged by technologies to thwart detection and
disruption.  Encrypted messaging apps help cartels coor dinate cross-border
transactions. Stablecoins and lightly regulated virtual asset platforms can
hide bribes and embezzled funds. Cybercriminals use AI-generated identities
and bots to deceive banks and evade outdated controls. Tracking proceeds
generated by organized crime is nearly impossible for underresourced agencies.
 AI lowers barriers to entry. Fraudsters with
voice-cloning and fake-document generators bypass the verification protocols
many banks and regulators still use. Their innovation is growing as compliance
systems lag. Governments recognize the threats, but responses are fragmented
and uneven—including in regulation of crypto exchanges. And there are
delays implementing the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF’s) “travel
rule” to better identify those send ing and receiving money across borders,
which most digital proceeds cross.
 Meanwhile, international financial flows are
increasingly complicated by instant transfers on decentralized platforms
and anonymity-enhancing tools. Most payments still go through multiple
inter mediaries, often layering cross-border transactions through antiquated
correspondent banks that obscure and delay transactions while raising costs.
This helps criminals exploit oversight gaps, jurisdic Authorities must keep

 Safe payment corridors There’s a parallel narrative. Criminals exploit inno

to reduce vulner abilities and modernize cross-border infrastruc ture. At the
same time, technological implications remain underexplored with respect to
anti–money laundering and countering the financing of terror ism, or AML/CFT.
Singapore’s and Thailand’s linked fast payment systems, for example,
enable real-time retail trans fers using mobile numbers; Indonesia and Malay
sia have connected QR codes for cross-border payments. Such innovations offer
efficiency and inclusion yet raise new issues regarding identity verification,
transaction monitoring, and regulatory coordination (see “Southeast Asia’s

 F&D “Regulators and fintechs should be partners, and sustained multilateral
engagement should foster fast, cheap, transparent, and traceable cross border
payments.” payments in India grew faster when interopera bility improved,
especially in fragmented markets where switching was costly, IMF research
shows (see “India’s Frictionless Payments” in this issue of F&D).  These
regional innovations and global initiatives reflect a growing understanding
that fighting crime and fostering inclusion are interlinked priorities—
 especially as criminals speed ahead. The FATF
echoed this concern, urging countries to design AML/CFT controls that support
inclusion and inno vation. Moreover, an FATF June recommendation marks a major
advance: Requiring originator and beneficiary information for cross-border
wire trans fers—including those involving virtual assets—will enhance
traceability across the fast-evolving digital f
 inancial ecosystem.
Efforts like these are important examples of how technology enables criminal
advantage, but tech nology must also be part of the regulatory response.
Modernizing cross-border payment systems and reducing unintended AML/CFT
barriers increasingly means focusing on transparency, interoperability, and
risk-based regulation. The IMF’s work on “safe pay ment corridors”
supports this by helping countries build trusted, secure channels for
legitimate finan cial flows without undermining new technology. A pilot with
Samoa—where de-risking has disrupted remittances—showed how targeted
safeguards and collaboration with regulated providers can preserve access
while maintaining financial integrity without disrupting the use of new
payment platforms.
 Machine learning Several countries, with IMF guidance, are invest
ing in machine learning to detect anomalies in cross-border financial flows,
and others are tight ening regulation of virtual asset service providers.
Governments are investing in their own capacity to trace crypto transfers,
and blockchain analytics f
 irms are often employed to do that.  IMF analysis of cross-border flows
 and the
updated FATF rules are mutually reinforcing. If implemented cohesively,
they can help digital effi ciency coexist with financial integrity. For that
to happen, legal frameworks must adapt to enable timely access to digital
evidence while preserving due process. Supervisory models need to evolve to
oversee both banks and nonbank financial institu tions offering cross-border
services. Regulators and f
 intechs should be partners, and sustained multilat
eral engagement should foster fast, cheap, transpar ent, and traceable
cross-border payments—anchored interoperable standards that also respect
privacy.
 Governments must keep up. That means invest
ing in regulatory technology, such as AI-powered transaction monitoring
and blockchain analysis, and giving agencies tools and expertise to detect
complex crypto schemes and synthetic identity fraud. Institutions must keep
pace with criminals by hiring and retaining expert data scientists and f
 inancial crime specialists. Virtual assets must be
brought under AML/CFT regulation, public-pri vate partnerships should
codevelop tools to spot emerging risks, and global standards from the FATF
and the Financial Stability Board must be backed by national investments in
effective AML/CFT frameworks.  Consistent and coordinated implementation is
important. Fragmented efforts leave openings for criminals. Their growing
technological advantage over governments threatens to undermine financial
integrity, destabilize economies, weaken already fragile institutions, and
erode public trust in sys tems meant to ensure safety and fairness. As crime
rings adopt and adapt emerging technologies to outpace enforcement, the cost
is not only fiscal—it is structural and systemic. Governments can’t wait.

currency, issued by a central bank.
 Decentralized finance

(DeFi)
 Ecosystem based on crypto assets
and smart contracts running on a distributed ledger, providing f
 inancial services without
centralized intermediaries.
 Smart contract Software that uses tokens
and automatically executes f
 inancial operations once
predefined terms are met—for example, selling an asset at a certain price.
 Central bank money comprises
banknotes in circulation, CBDCs where they exist, and reserves that commercial
banks maintain at a central bank. Commercial money refers primarily to
deposits in private banks.  Physical cash is central bank money; cash
deposited in a bank account is commercial money.
 Clearance and
settlement
 Clearance means validating both
sides of a transaction to ensure that the buyer can pay and the seller
can deliver the goods or assets. Settlement is the actual and irrevocable
transfer of money and assets between the parties.
 Collateral Asset that a borrower pledges
to a lender as a guarantee. For example, banks pledge assets as collateral
to a central bank in exchange for short-term liquidity.
 Custodian Institution that safeguards
f

of a buyer and seller. It may provide other services during transactions
and ensure compliance with regulatory and tax obligations.
 Interoperability Ability of different systems,
platforms, or technologies to connect seamlessly—for example, the same
terminal being able to accept cards from all banks and brands.
 Zero-knowledge proofs Cryptographic method that allows
parties in a transaction to prove they know something without revealing
what it is—for example, to demonstrate compliance with tax and anti-money

 Feature How the Battle for
Control Could Crush AI’s Promise
 Carl Benedikt Frey A SHIFT TOWARD CENTRALIZATION AND CONCENTRATION
COULD SNUFF OUT TECHNOLOGY’S PRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL
 In the mid-20th century, the Soviet Union’s tech
nological successes, notably launching Sputnik and sending Yuri Gagarin
into space, convinced many observers that centrally planned econo mies might
outperform market-driven ones.  Prominent economists such as Paul Samuelson
predicted that the USSR would soon overtake the United States economically,
while Oskar Lange, a Polish economist and socialist, argued that emerg ing
computer technologies could effectively replace the outdated market mechanism.
 Yet, paradoxically, the USSR collapsed just as the
computer revolution took off. Despite considerable investments—including
Nikita Khrushchev’s attempt to create a Soviet counterpart to Silicon Valley
on the edge of Moscow in Zelenograd—the USSR failed to harness the promise
of computing technology. The obstacle was not a shortage of scientific talent,
but institutions inhospitable to exploration. Whereas Sili con Valley thrived
on decentralized experimentation, with inventors job-hopping among start-ups
running multiple concurrent experiments, innovation in Zel enograd was
centrally controlled and orchestrated entirely by Moscow government officials.
 As Friedrich Hayek argued, the main difficulty
with central planning wasn’t processing data but gathering essential
local knowledge. Soviet plan ners could manage standardized operations but
faltered during technological uncertainty, lacking benchmarks to monitor
factory performance and punish slackers. Despite early rapid growth,
the USSR stagnated, unable to adapt to new techno logical frontiers, and
eventually collapsed.
 These insights are still relevant, particularly as
new forms of artificial intelligence again raise the question of whether
centralized authority, such as China’s AI-driven surveillance state, or
corporate concentration—as among Silicon Valley’s big tech companies—can
leverage new technologies effec tively to manage the economy and society.  50

Frontier innovation
 Conventional theories of wealth and poverty that
emphasize factors like geography, culture, or insti tutions struggle to explain
dramatic economic reversals. Geographic conditions, which remained unchanged,
cannot account for the USSR’s shift from rapid growth to collapse. Cultural
factors also evolve too slowly to explain swift economic booms and sub
sequent busts. While institutions such as laws and regulations can change more
abruptly, institutional theories based on universal conditions are similarly
incomplete; for instance, both the USSR and China experienced decades of
rapid growth despite lacking secure private property rights. Ultimately,
under standing economic progress requires examining how institutions and
culture interact dynamically with technological changes.
 Recognizing that economic performance is tied
to this shifting interaction reframes the familiar policy debate over
technological progress. One side advocates decentralized innovation driven
by small f
 irms in lightly regulated markets; the other pro
motes state-led industrial policy executed by pow erful bureaucracies. However,
both approaches are optimal only under certain conditions: Central ized
bureaucracies effectively exploit accessible technologies and drive catch-up
growth, whereas decentralized systems excel at pioneering innova tions at
the technological frontier. Over time, eco nomic governance must adapt or
risk stagnation.
 Japan as Number One Even when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991,
America’s relief was tempered by a new anxiety: Many scholars and journalists
believed that Japan would soon eclipse the US. Ezra Vogel’s 1979 best seller,
Japan as Number One, had already warned of Tokyo’s growing edge in computers
and semicon ductors, a gain seemingly as dramatic as its earlier rise in
automobiles. Yet the computer revolution Illustration by Brian Stauffer F&D
 Feature that followed told a different story. From the early
1990s US software-driven productivity soared, while Japanese firms clung
stubbornly to hardware.
 Japan’s ascent had rested on a tightly coordi
nated production system. Because Japanese firms could take equity stakes
in their suppliers—some thing US antitrust law discouraged—they wove
dense knowledge networks reinforced by just-in time logistics, computer-aided
design, and repro grammable machine tools. The result was striking efficiency:
Japanese autoworkers were 17 percent more productive than their US counterparts
by 1980, leading Ford and GM to report steep losses.
 The Japanese edge, however, came less from
inventing new products than from refining Western ones. Color televisions,
the Walkman, and VCRs became global hits only after Japanese engineers
reengineered them for cost and durability. In a sem inal study, economist
Edwin Mansfield found that roughly two-thirds of Japanese R&D targeted pro
cess improvements—the mirror image of the prod uct-heavy US effort—allowing
faster translation of laboratory advances into cheap, marketable goods.
 But those very strengths became limitations.
Eminent observers such as Alfred Chandler Jr. had expected the computer age to
reward hardware perfection and streamlined production—factors that favored
Japan—but it was the dynamism of US start-ups like Apple and Microsoft
that proved deci sive. US antitrust policy, rooted in the 1890 Sher man
Antitrust Act, pried open markets by forcing IBM to unbundle its hardware
and software and by breaking up AT&T just before the commer cial internet
took off. Without a single gatekeeper, entrepreneurs could innovate freely,
and the web expanded unimpeded.
 Japan’s looser competition rules, by contrast,
fostered cartelization and entrenched keiretsu conglomerates. The
same coordination that once sped incremental upgrades now slowed the
leap to software and internet-based business models, crowding out new
entrants. Japan’s technological momentum stalled. Even within the US,
regions organized around fierce competition, such as Sil icon Valley,
outperformed more hierarchical, ver tically integrated areas like New
England’s Route 128 tech cluster.
 End of coordinated capitalism Japan is not an isolated example. After
 World War
II, Western Europe’s economy grew quickly by adopting US methods of mass
production across a broad range of industries. This strategy worked well
for several decades, but by the 1970s, Europe had exhausted the backlog of
American technology.  To maintain growth, it would need to shift toward a model
based on innovation rather than merely catch up with existing technologies.
 This shift proved challenging. Europe’s eco
nomic institutions were shaped by a long history of industrial catch-up,
established in the late 19th century to absorb British technology and
reinforced during the postwar era when Europe was closing the gap with the
US. These institutions were designed to support stable and predictable economic
growth through careful planning, coordinated industries, and close cooperation
between businesses, banks, and governments. Such coordinated capitalism was
effective when the task was clear—catching up with established industrial
practices—but became an obstacle when faced with the uncertainty and dis
ruption caused by the computer revolution and new information technologies.
 In France, the government’s system of indica

 tive planning, which set economic targets to coor
dinate investments, worked well with incremental and predictable technological
progress. But with rapid technological change, planners were over whelmed and
unable to forecast accurately and direct resources effectively.  Similarly,
Italy’s state-owned enterprises, cru cial during the postwar boom, proved
rigid and unresponsive to a new age of technological turbu lence. In Spain
and Portugal, the heavy influence of the state, combined with entrenched
interests, severely limited economic flexibility, hampering innovation
and adaptation. Consequently, these Southern European nations experienced
prolonged economic stagnation during the computer revolu tion, often referred
to as “two lost decades.”
 From Hayek to Moravec The lesson is clear: Economic miracles stall when
the institutions that enabled past successes become misaligned with new
challenges. The Soviet Union and much of Europe stumbled when rigid mass pro
duction models failed to adapt to the unpredictabil ity of the computer age,
while Japan faltered as the epicenter of innovation shifted from hardware to
software. Today, China’s growth is increasingly constrained by tightened
party control, and the US faces a similar peril whenever monopoly power remains
unchecked. The danger that centraliza tion and concentration will snuff
out innovation now hangs over AI. Because AI performance has historically
improved mainly by scaling up com puting power and data availability,
many observers concluded that AI is a contest best left to a handful of
“national champions.” That belief is seductive—
 and mistaken.

assesses advanced problem-solving abilities. Meanwhile, leaner approaches
such as program search (which gener ates explicit programs to solve tasks)
have topped 20 percent, and newer in-context learning meth ods (where models
learn from examples without retraining) are racing ahead.
 Nor will AI soon make human exploration obso
lete. Hans Moravec’s old observation still holds: What is effortless for
humans (such as walking a trail) remains hard for machines, and vice versa.
Language models trained on the entire internet still lack the sensorimotor
experience of any four-year old. Until we can encode that embodied knowledge,
centralized AI systems will trail the decentralized experimentation billions
of humans perform daily.
 Ingenuity flourishes precisely where precedent
is thin. Inventors, scientists, and entrepreneurs thrive on turning the unknown
into opportunity. By contrast, large language models default to statisti
cal consensus. Imagine an LLM trained in 1633—it would steadfastly uphold
Earth as the universe’s center; given 19th century literature, it would con f
 idently deny that humans could ever fly, echoing
the long list of failed trials that preceded the Wright brothers’
success. Even Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis admits reaching true
artificial general intelligence may need “several more innovations.”
 Control and competition Those are unlikely to emerge from centralized
scale alone; they will come, as before, from wid ening the arena of
experimentation and lowering the barriers to entry. However, in the age of
AI, both China and the US are moving in the opposite direction, increasing
central control and reducing competitive dynamism.
 China’s most dynamic sectors remain driven
by private or foreign-backed firms, while state owned enterprises lag. Yet
Beijing is recentralizing authority: Licenses, credit, and contracts now favor
politically reliable conglomerates, antitrust law is wielded selectively,
and anti-corruption campaigns make loyalty a prerequisite for survival.
Once-vital provincial experimentation has withered as offi cials chase crude
indicators such as patent counts, f
 looding registries with low-value filings. Patronage
is eclipsing transparent rules, and loyalty is displac ing competence,
eroding the state’s capacity to nur ture frontier-level innovation and
pushing the econ omy toward slower, less-innovation-driven growth.
 talent pool and a government deeply committed
to technological advancement. But as in Western countries, firms lacking
strong political connec tions—such as the AI start-up DeepSeek—prove most
innovative. Although authorities might per mit these companies to operate
with relative auton omy as long as their activities align with national
goals, the absence of robust legal protections leaves them vulnerable to
shifts in political priorities. Con sequently, firms must invest resources
in building political alliances, diverting attention and capital from
driving innovation. And the government’s control over critical information
technologies frequently tempts authorities to strengthen their political
dominance over society, potentially sti f
 ling grassroots innovation.  The US shows the same symptoms in differ
ent guise. Since the computer era of the 1990s, its industries have grown
markedly more concen trated, undercutting the fluid competition that once
characterized Silicon Valley. A web of non compete clauses now hampers labor
mobility, curbs the flow of tacit knowledge, and discourages sci entists
and engineers from founding rival firms.  Because start-ups are central
to translating labo ratory insights into commercial products, this drag on
talent circulation weakens the very mechanism—
 creative destruction—that reallocates market share
toward fresh ideas. Economists Germán Gutiér rez and Thomas Philippon
show that the trend is driven less by unavoidable scale economies than
by incumbent lobbying that hard-codes regulatory advantages, from patent
extensions to sector-spe cific licensing hurdles.
 This pattern also threatens AI. Beneath today’s
veneer of intense competition, Microsoft’s deep alliance with OpenAI already
controls about 70 percent of the commercial LLM market, while Nvidia provides
about 92 percent of the special ized graphics-processing units (GPUs) used to
train these models. Together with Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta, these incumbents
have also been quietly buying stakes in promising AI start-ups. Sustain ing
a policy regime that safeguards the competitive arena itself, rather than
the fortunes of particular f
 irms, is essential if the next generation of transfor
mative innovators is to deliver the promised boost to productivity. That’s
as true for the AI age as it was for the computer era. F&D

Geography of Start-ups
 Swati Bhatt US ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY IS MIGRATING FROM
TRADITIONAL HUBS LIKE CALIFORNIA TO MORE RURAL WESTERN AND SOUTHERN STATES
 In Laramie, Wyoming, start-up Airloom Energy
is reimagining traditional wind turbine design.  Instead of three-bladed
turbines atop tall tow ers, the company’s system uses wing-like blades
traveling along a horizontal oval track like a roller coaster. This technology
is more compact and easier to transport than traditional turbines, with
lower costs. The company plans to break ground this year on a pilot project.
 Airloom is not alone. Wyoming, the least popu
lous US state, has seen 50 percent growth in start-ups over the past
decade. The state is one of the winners as entrepreneurial activity has
dispersed geographi cally in recent years, spurred by the adoption of arti f
 icial intelligence technology (AI tech) and the shift
to remote and hybrid work.  In the US, innovation hubs such as New York
and California’s Silicon Valley are giving way to new geographies. Small
businesses are popping up across western and southeastern states, such as
Wyoming and Georgia. Seven of the top ten states in entrepreneurial activity
are south of the famed Mason-Dixon Line—the historic bound ary between
Northern and Southern states—or the 36th parallel, a more southerly
demarcation line (Chart 1).  Start-up clusters
 The decentralization of innovation has enabled
smaller cities and rural areas to develop start-up clusters. Some of
these reflect the proliferation of data centers in regions with abundant
land, electric power, and water—and, crucially, friendly local reg
ulations. Western states may lack water, but they more than make up for it
with the regulatory envi ronment tech companies want.  JPMorgan Chase and
Starwood Property Trust have committed $2 billion for a 100-acre data center
development in West Jordan, Utah, near Salt Lake City. JPMorgan Chase made a
loan of $2.3 billion in January 2025 for a facility in Abilene, Texas. Meta
plans to build an $800 million, 715,000-square foot data center in Cheyenne,
Wyoming. Amazon is building two data centers in Madison County, Mississippi,
for a total cost of $10 billion. Google is building a $2 billion center in Fort
Wayne, Indi ana, and a $1 billion center in Virginia.  Data centers act as a
focal point for start-ups, fos tering an entrepreneurial culture that applauds
and even encourages risk taking. Moreover, a sociocul tural mindset stemming
from geographic proximity of firms along the AI tech supply chain encourages
entrepreneurs to experiment and innovate rapidly.  Illustration by Dan Bejar

 Advances in AI tech have spurred the formation

tasks traditionally dominated by large corporations, such as analyzing

 Innovation lies at the heart of productivity
increases as new technologies encourage busi nesses to adopt new operational
styles. For exam ple, medical offices in Boise, Idaho, can use AI tech to
read X-rays without the need for a large hospital.  Manufacturing firms
leverage advanced analytics to manage inventory. Workers in remote Wyoming
use AI tech to streamline processes like data entry, scheduling, and email
management. According to PitchBook, which maintains a database on global
capital markets, AI start-ups racked up 22 percent of f
 irst-time venture capital financing in 2024.
Start-ups and new businesses have the agility to easily incorporate new
technologies, unconstrained by legacy frameworks. According to Emin Dinlersoz
and Nathan Goldschlag, writing for the US Census Bureau, “since the early
fall of 2023, the smallest firms had a relatively high AI use rate, although
the rate of increase was lower than for larger firms.” Correspond ingly,
an increase in start-ups often leads to higher labor productivity and
potentially higher wages.
 The Census Bureau’s Business Formation Sta
tistics collect data on business applications, a good way of measuring idea
generation that leads to busi ness start-ups. As Chart 2 indicates, there
has been an explosion in new business applications since the onset of the
pandemic in 2020.
 Another metric uses Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) data on planned wage payouts to measure the launch of new
businesses. Whereas Census data highlight idea formation, the BLS data capture
idea implementation. A key question in examining inno vation is whether an
idea becomes significant only when it leads to hiring or whether the birth
of the idea itself qualifies as innovation.  The BLS data also show a sharp
increase in entrepreneurial activity across the US during 2010 20 compared
with the previous decade. Of the 15 top performing states, 10—California,
Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Utah,
and Washington—lie west of the Mis sissippi River. Conversely, the 15
weakest-perform ing states are located east of the Mississippi.
 Economic dynamism Before the pandemic, there was sizable entrepre

 be changing though. Census data show that 7 of the
top 10 states for start-up activity in 2010–25 were in F&D
 lina, and Cummings Research Park in Huntsville,
Alabama—the second-largest research park, with the South, as the map shows.
 The question is whether all this start-up activity
is contributing significantly to job growth. Recent research published
by the Federal Reserve suggests that the recent wave of start-ups is less
likely than pre vious upsurges to contribute to employment growth.  Young,
high-growth start-ups accounted for less than 6 percent of employment in 2024,
compared with almost 10 percent in 1985, according to the Fed. AI tech–driven
start-ups tend to be capital- and skill-in tensive, requiring fewer workers.
 Productivity and wage increases manifest in the
highest-skilled workers; automation reduces the wages of those engaged in
routine tasks. Economic dynamism—whereby new businesses boost eco nomic
growth—may well reflect not so much large start-ups employing large numbers
of workers as an increase in the number of start-ups, each one spawning more
such firms thanks to a boost in the region’s risk-taking culture.
 This may help explain why population density
is unrelated to entrepreneurial activity. Among the top 10 states for
start-up activity, New Mexico and Wyoming have between 5 and 20 people per
square mile. By contrast, Florida and Texas, also in the top 10, are among
the most populous states, with 150 to 400 people per square mile.
 In addition, larger firms often acquire start-up
founders’ ideas, which reduces the need for inde pendent growth. For example,
Microsoft acquired all of Inflection AI, and its entire 70-person work force,
in 2024, and in 2022 acquired Nuance Com munications, a leader in speech
recognition and conversational AI.  Targeted investing
 This shift in activity from the Western states to
the South Atlantic states in the postpandemic years is remarkable. Key reasons
behind this trend include venture capital reallocation, aggressive state-led
incentives (tax breaks and public-private R&D partnerships), cost-of-living
advantages, enhanced ecosystem building (incubators), and remote work
trends. The Southeastern states’ more nuanced approach to investing—writing
smaller, more directed checks to promising founders—has proved to be more
resilient in the face of high exit rates for start-ups.  Manufacturing and
research are important drivers. Automobile manufacturing clusters, led by
Mercedes-Benz USA and Porsche North Amer ica, have headquarters in the Atlanta,
Georgia, area. The 7,000-acre research cluster in Research Triangle Park in
Raleigh-Durham, North Caro business incubators and Fortune 500 companies—
 have generated favorable spillover effects in the
areas’ business climate. Most of these start-ups are integrating AI tech
into their normal business functions: It is a tool in the general toolbox,
as illustrated by the multibillion-dollar deals made by OpenAI with gaming
company Epic Games and the fintech OneTrust in 2020, both headquartered in
the Southeast.
 The case of Wyoming is unique. Wyoming
has no state income tax or corporate income tax, low business formation costs
and filing fees, and no citizenship or residency requirements. The state
has strong privacy protections as it doesn’t share business or personal
records with outside agencies. In 2023, the Wyoming Banking Board approved

 der that entrepreneurs consider Wyoming a top
choice for start-ups.  Innovation and entrepreneurial activity are not
inherently confined to historically established regions. Emerging areas
can cultivate and adapt their entrepreneurial ecosystems to harness local
potential and evolve into dynamic start-up hubs.  This ability makes them a
compelling model for less-developed economies seeking to stimulate economic
growth through entrepreneurship. There are nevertheless challenges, such as
the need to provide cheap energy and other resources to power data centers
and other power-hungry facilities. Pol icymakers can play a critical role
through targeted industrial policy—investing in infrastructure, edu cation,
and regulatory frameworks that foster inno vation and lower entry barriers

MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY DON’T QUITE MEASURE UP
 Amid this year’s geopolitical rifts, one sig
nal of uncertainty is flashing red; another, green; and a third,
amber. Ordinarily, they tend to track one another.
 This is no parlor game. High levels of
uncertainty can freeze investment and consump tion, tank markets, and help
spark a recession.
 What are we to make of this in assessing the
direction of the global economy?  Let’s start with a review of how
economists, investors, and policymakers gauge uncertainty.
 How high is uncertainty?  Measuring uncertainty is not easy. The questions
are uncertainty about whom, over what, and for what time period. There is
no single dominant met ric for uncertainty.  The three main measures rely
on textual analy sis, financial markets, and business surveys. Text based
measures now show exceptionally high levels of uncertainty. Everything
you read, from newspapers to country reports to official publica tions,
seems to discuss uncertainty. Financial-mar ket-based measures, meanwhile,
show only mod erate levels of uncertainty. And survey-based measures, which
spiked during the pandemic, have largely flatlined.  Perhaps the best-known
text-based metric is the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) Index developed
by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016).  The index analyzes articles in hundreds
of news papers for mentions of terms related to econom ics, policy, and
uncertainty. This century, the EPU for the United States has typically surged
during crises, spiking after events like the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020
COVID pandemic (Chart 1). In 2025, the EPU reached a record high, indicating
extensive discussions of uncertainty in national and local newspapers.
 One concern with the EPU is that it may reflect
media bias. We developed a second set of indicators based on the Economist
Intelligence Unit’s coun try reports (Ahir, Bloom, and Furceri 2022). These
reports appear monthly and provide a detailed 58

 discussion of political and economic conditions in

“uncertain,” we created the World Uncertainty Index (WUI). It shows
a similar trajectory as the EPU, suggesting that perceptions of elevated

 solely media-driven.
Concerns about using textual data to measure uncertainty include the evolution
of language, potential bias in sources, and inaccuracies in word counts as
measures of intensity. An alternative approach is to examine financial market
volatility.  The 32-year-old Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index,
known as the VIX, embodies this concept. It calculates the one-month-ahead
implied volatility of the S&P 500 Index of US stocks, based on a basket of
put and call options.  Significant spikes in the VIX over the past three
decades occurred around economic and political shocks, such as the Asian
and Russian financial crises in 1997 and 1998, the 2008 financial crisis,
the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, and the 2020 pandemic (Chart 2). In 2025,
the VIX has been elevated—
 reaching 32 in April—but that was not a large spike
compared with previous jumps.  Other market-based measures—such as the
Intercontinental Exchange Bank of America MOVE Index of implied volatility
on bond yields—pres ent a similar picture of increased but not extreme
uncertainty.

 Feature sions about hiring and investment, which drive
economic growth.  The US Survey of Business Uncertainty (SBU), administered
by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, queries almost 1,000 US businesses
each month, collecting information about sales forecasts. As Altig and
others (2020) show, these forecasts accu rately predict business actions,
including current and future hiring, investment, and sales.  This metric
showed a significant surge in uncer tainty during the pandemic, roughly
doubling between January and May 2020, before slowly eas ing (Chart
3). Through June 2025, there was no uncer tainty surge. One explanation
is that businesses may not be following the economic or political news.
However, the SBU panel did notably raise predic tions for sales growth after
the November 2024 election of Donald Trump. The forecasts declined in spring
2025 after the beginning of tariff wars.  The UK’s Decision Maker Panel
collects simi lar measures of company-level sales growth uncer tainty. It
polls about 2,500 businesses a month across the UK. As Chart 3 also shows,
the UK sales uncertainty index followed a pattern similar to that of the US
measure, with a surge during the pan demic but no recent increase.  It’s a
little puzzling that the survey-based met rics don’t show a rise through
June 2025, whereas the market-based measures increased moderately and the
text-based indicators surged. These indices tracked each other remarkably
closely over previ ous episodes, such as the pandemic and the finan cial
crisis. One explanation is that text measures are excessively high because
of the intense media focus on the Trump administration. Another is that
because our financial and business measures are shorter term and US-focused,
they may miss the rise in longer-term global uncertainty. Our sense is that
the truth is somewhere in between—global uncertainty has risen, but not
as much as text-based measures would suggest.
 Uncertainty and growth
Economists have been developing theories for decades about the economic
impact of uncertainty.  One body of research focuses on “real options,”
or the idea that companies look at their invest ment choices as a series of
options. For example, a supermarket chain that owns a plot of land has the
option to build a new store there. If the supermar ket becomes uncertain
about the future because it is unsure whether a local housing development
will proceed, it may opt to wait. In such a case, the option value of delay
is high when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty makes businesses cautious
about investment and hiring.

 helping to drive business cycles. These effects seem
sal. They arise only when decisions cannot be eas ily reversed. Even when
uncertainty is high, busi nesses may be happy to hire part-time employees or
rent rather than buy equipment. If conditions deteriorate, they can easily cut
the workers and return the rented gear. High uncertainty tends to both reduce
overall activity and shift it into more reversible choices.  Uncertainty can
also push individuals to post pone consumption. People can easily delay
deci sions on buying durables like housing, cars, and furniture. Someone
thinking about moving to another house could either do so this year or wait
until next year. The option value of waiting will be much higher when income
uncertainty is greater.  Finally, uncertainty can increase the cost of f
 inance (Fernandez-Villaverde and others 2011).
Investors want to be compensated for higher risk, and because greater
uncertainty leads to higher risk premiums, it raises the cost of
borrowing. Uncer tainty also increases the probability of default.  There is a
growing body of research estimating the impact of uncertainty on businesses,
consum ers, and the overall economy. Findings generally show that greater
uncertainty has a strong impact on reducing investment and a weaker effect
on low ering employment and consumption—while overall CHART 3

 to be magnified when financial conditions are tight:
Uncertainty and financial frictions can have a mul tiplicative impact
on each other.  Clearly, a surge in uncertainty of the size implied by
this year’s text-based measures could be extremely damaging for growth,
potentially lead ing to a global recession. But a rise in uncertainty of the
size signaled by financial markets might only slow growth without generating a
recession. And, if the business surveys are correct, uncertainty has changed
little over the past year.  Our best guess is that uncertainty is not as high
as indicated by the text measures, which may be distorted by the turmoil in
US politics. But uncer tainty is not as low as suggested by business sur veys
focusing on year-ahead sales. Many drivers of uncertainty are longer term
or will not manifest in sales.  We see uncertainty as having risen above
its long-term levels without reaching the peaks of the global financial
crisis or the pandemic. As such, we think the 2025 surge in uncertainty
will slow growth by reducing investment, hiring, and con sumer spending on
durable goods. This is likely to happen through 2025 and 2026 as the impact
of uncertainty typically takes 6 to 18 months to slow growth (Caldara and
Iacoviello 2022). But the rise in uncertainty is not large enough to induce a
global recession. F&D hites ahir is a senior research officer in the IMF’s

 Feature When Free Trade
First Faltered
 Marc-William Palen GLOBALIZATION’S FIRST AGE SOME 200 YEARS AGO HELD
CONTRADICTIONS THAT SHED LIGHT ON TODAY’S TURN TOWARD ECONOMIC NATIONALISM
 The “first age” of globalization was beset
by contradictions. In the 60 years or so before World War I, global trade
grew rap idly despite the ever-higher tariff walls built by the rising
protectionist empires of the United States, Germany, Russia, France,
and Japan. Geopolitical conflicts and trade wars grew more common even as
markets became more inte grated. These contradictions were at the heart of
heated debates over free trade and economic nationalism that dominated the
industrializing world at the time.
 Emerging economic nationalism today eerily
echoes the first age of globalization—and is an even bigger bundle of
contradictions. Nationalist forces reemerged from the Great Recession of
2008–09 as a potent political and economic force across the globe. And
yet ours is a world of extraordinary eco nomic interdependence wrought from
technolog ical marvels, the likes of which the science fiction writer Jules
Verne could only dream.  Between the 1840s and 1860s, trade liberaliza
tion appeared to be the name of the globalization game. Britain ushered
in the mid-century flirta tion with free trade, when the island nation’s
liber als successfully overturned the Corn Laws. These protective tariffs
on foreign grain benefited landed aristocrats but forced the working-class
poor to pay more to feed themselves. Britain’s free-trade advo cates made
a compelling case to the public that get ting rid of grain tariffs would
usher in a new era of cheap and plentiful food for the hungry masses pouring
into its industrial centers.  But they also made a compelling case that a
peaceful and prosperous world of economic inter dependence was possible—if
Britain’s imperial rivals also liberalized their markets. After all,
why seize colonies or wage war over raw materials when the world’s
products could be purchased through peaceful market competition? As Richard
Cobden, Britain’s mid-century “apostle of free trade,” put it, trade
liberalization would so unite the world that militant landed elites could
no longer “plunge their people into wars.”

 Feature The national system Some, like the German-American protectionist the
orist Friedrich List, disagreed. During his US exile, List updated Alexander
Hamilton’s 18th century economic nationalist vision for the rapidly globaliz
ing world of the 1840s. After returning to Germany, he published his 1841
magnum opus, The National System of Political Economy, in the hope of counter
ing the cosmopolitan call of free trade.  The British had, he warned, relied
on decades of protectionism to reach the industrial summit. They now sought
to “kick away the ladder” so that oth ers could not challenge their
position as “manufac turer of the world.” List called on Britain’s
imperial rivals to establish strong nation-states—with high tariffs to
foster “infant” industries into adulthood and colonial expansion to
exploit the raw materials of Latin America, Asia, and Africa.  List’s
imperial protectionist proposal fell on deaf European and American ears at
the time. Advocates of trade liberalization seemed poised to win the day.
In 1846, Britain’s liberal free-trade visionaries cel ebrated the demise
of the Corn Laws. Thanks to Cobden and his middle-class supporters, Britain
became the first imperial power to unilaterally embrace free trade. Cobden’s
non-intervention ist wing in Parliament also fought unsuccessfully against
coercive mid-century free-trade policies in colonial spaces such as India
and China.  Cobden and his followers next turned their free trade attention
to the US and the European conti nent. In 1846, the US followed Britain’s
lead and substantially lowered its tariffs. European trade liberalization,
however, required more diplo macy. The 1860 Anglo-French (or Cobden-Che valier)
commercial treaty signaled that Europe’s two biggest imperial rivals might
be ready to turn their swords into ploughshares. The treaty’s inno vative
inclusion of a most-favored-nation clause granted other European powers the
same low tariff treatment if they responded in kind. About 50 or 60 trade
treaties were signed, locking Europe into what was effectively its first
common market.  Technological tools
 A more liberal economic order was coming, and
the technological tools of globalization’s first age seemed well placed
to tie it all together. Transoce anic steamship lines drastically lowered
transporta tion costs and travel times. The transatlantic cable, successfully
laid in 1866, meant that messages between Wall Street and the City of London
took mere minutes. The opening of the Suez Canal in Egypt and the completion
of the US transcontinen tal railway in 1869 shrank the world even further.
These developments sparked the globalist imagi nation, including Jules
Verne’s Around the World in Eighty Days (1872).
 But globalization’s unprecedented interdepen
dence soon landed the industrializing world in an unpredictable boom-bust
economic cycle. Low transportation costs, mass industrialization, and trade
liberalization cut costs for consumers, but the steep fall in prices also meant
tighter profit margins, or even losses, for many of the world’s exporters.
The British-led gold standard greased the wheels of international trade,
but its deflationary effects spelled doom for many debt-ridden agrarians
and manufacturers.  The first age of globalization was facing the first
Great Depression (1873–96), and protectionism and colonialism were the
policies of choice of the industrializing world. Globalization’s protesters
grew louder. As is common during economic cri sis, cries for national
self-sufficiency drowned out calls for cosmopolitan comity. Free trade
fell out of fashion among Britain’s imperial rivals, who redis covered
the protectionist ideas of List, catapulting him from pariah to prophet.
Economic conspiracy
 Imperial-minded economic nationalists across the
globe began to revere List’s national system as eco nomic divination. Free
trade was seen as part of a vast British conspiracy to thwart the
industrializa tion projects of rivals—a self-serving trick to under mine
emerging industries elsewhere. List-inspired economic nationalists saw
geopolitics as a zero sum game in which only the fittest would survive.
The technological tools of globalization that not so long ago promised to
tie the world together in benign universalism now seemed better suited for
binding colonies to imperial metropoles. Tariff walls grew ever higher,
turning infant industries into monopolies, cartels, and trusts. Monopoly-in
duced market inefficiencies at home soon sparked an interimperial search for
new markets to export surplus capital and acquire raw materials. Trade wars,
military interventions, and the scramble for colonies in Africa and Asia
picked up pace.  By 1880, economic nationalists had the upper hand. Their
imperial protectionist politics moved ever more to the right. In the US,
the Republican Party rebranded itself as the party of protectionism and big
business, reversing the freer trade trend of the preceding decades. The 1890
McKinley Tariff, which imposed an unprecedented average rate of about 50
percent, plunged the country into trade wars with European trading partners.
But the Benjamin Harrison administration encouraged the tariff’s passage
with one particular imperial acquisition in mind: Canada. It hoped that 64

the British-controlled northern neighbor would seek admission to the US
rather than pay the exorbitantly high tariff. Canada’s Conservative
Party instead established closer economic ties within the British Empire;
the newly completed Canadian Pacific Rail way made Canada a land bridge
connecting Britain with its far-flung colonies in the Pacific.  In Germany,
Otto von Bismarck, who was rumored to keep The National System as bedside
reading, in Listian fashion consolidated the Ger man states, erected tariff
walls around them, and looked abroad for new colonies. His successor, Will
helm II, started construction of the Berlin-to-Bagh dad railway to better
connect them. And in Russia, Count Sergei Witte explicitly styled himself
after List. Whether as director of railway affairs, finance minister, or prime
minister, Witte remained well placed from the early 1890s to start construction
of the Trans-Siberian railway to facilitate Russia’s imperial designs on
Manchuria. Similar economic nationalist stories played out within the empires
of France and Japan.  Marginalized liberal defenders of free trade turned to
grassroots organizing to stem the mount ing protectionist imperial tide. In
the US, Henry George, a San Francisco journalist, wrote Progress and Poverty
(1879), an international bestseller and a road map for breaking up the land
monopolies of the railway tycoons, aristocrats, and speculators, by imposing
a tax on the potential value of land. His idea became known as Georgism,
or the “single tax,” because it promised to do away with all other forms
of taxation, including tariffs.  The single-tax movement’s promotion of an
interdependent world of absolute free trade devoid of land monopolies found
an international welcome.  Russian writer and pacifist Leo Tolstoy became an
ardent disciple, believing that the single tax was the antidote to the poison
of serfdom. While residing in the first age of globalization. The Georgist
“Land Song” was a rip-roaring anthem sung at Liberal Party gatherings.
At the same time, the economist J. A. Hobson enunciated one of the most
scathing critiques of monopoly capitalism and the scramble for colo nies in
Imperialism: A Study (1902). Eight years later, Norman Angell, a journalist,
became so concerned about a looming global conflict that he warned of the
“great illusion” that any nation could win from war: World markets were
so interdependent that even the so-called winners would lose. The outbreak
of World War I four years later proved him right.
 The similarities between then and now are hid
ing in plain sight. The quarter century between the end of the Corn Laws
in 1846 and the start of the global turn to protectionism in the early
1870s saw unprecedented trade liberalization, as did the 25 years after
the end of the Cold War. And much as the 19th century liberal free-trade
advocates under appreciated the political appeal of nationalism and economic
self-sufficiency, so too were their intel lectual successors in the late
20th century precipi tous in predicting the end of the nation-state—and
even the end of history.  Because history hasn’t ended, it remains a use
ful guide. Today’s cosmopolitan supporters of eco nomic interdependence
should understand how their counterparts more than a century ago fought to
transform their economic nationalist era of globalization into a more peaceful
and equitable free-trade world. Their longer-term successes are a testament to
how international cooperation can counteract nationalist-driven conflict. F&D

 People in Economics A Causal Pioneer Gary Seidman profiles Stanford economist
Guido Imbens, who is reshaping how researchers establish cause and effect in
the real world there have been a couple of times in Guido Imbens’ life when
he has been seriously underestimated. Once, as a diligent schoolboy in The
Netherlands, young Guido was unceremoniously banished for weeks from his first
economics class after clashing with a teacher over a textbook. Years later,
during a faculty interview at Har vard University, a combative associate
professor—who ultimately became Imbens’ closest friend and corecipient
of the Nobel Prize in Economics—voted against hiring him. “He thought the
work I was doing in my thesis was boring,” Imbens says. “It was very dry
and technical,” Joshua Angrist recalls with a chuckle three decades later.
 There are some things in life and in economics that you can’t fully
 know. Imbens
shared the 2021 Nobel Prize with Angrist, of the Massachusetts Institute of
Tech nology, and labor economist David Card, of the University of California,
Berkeley, for transforming how economists understand cause and effect. Imbens
and Angrist developed tools to answer life’s What if? questions, not only
to explain what actually occurred but also to use natural experiments to
estimate what would have happened if circumstances had been different. Take
a basic question: Does going to college really cause people to earn more
money over their careers? You can’t run a perfect experiment by sending the

F&D
 People in Economics same time, you can’t send two people
down different life paths solely for the purpose of an experiment; that would
be unethical.  So Imbens and his colleagues designed and tested sharper tools
to work with real-world data—messy, imperfect, observational data—to esti
mate outcomes that otherwise can’t be directly observed. They pioneered
causal inference, which, for example, compares similar people who, by chance
or circumstance, make different choices.  For instance, during the Vietnam
War, a draft lottery randomly assigned young men draft numbers. Those hold ing
low numbers were more likely to face conscription. Many young men could avoid
military service by enroll ing in college. The draft lottery thus created a
kind of natural experiment, allowing researchers to compare out comes, such as
earnings, between simi lar individuals—some who served in the military and
some who didn’t—primarily because of their randomly assigned draft number
and its influence on their likeli hood of being drafted, rather than solely
on personal motivation. Why does that matter? Because correlation isn’t
enough.  If a government wants to expand oppor tunities and boost incomes,
it needs to know whether college really causes higher earnings—not just
that they often go together. Today, these methods help policymakers, doctors,
businesses, and researchers make better decisions based on real-life evidence.
 Fruitful friendships The turning point in Imbens’ career
came in the early 1990s at Harvard, when—despite a rocky start—he struck
up a collaboration and lasting friendship with Angrist. Their partnership
took shape not in a classroom but in a local laundromat. The two were junior
faculty members who often found themselves folding shirts and trading ideas
to the hum of tumbling clothes dryers on Sat urday mornings. “It’s more
fun to work with your friends,” says Angrist. “I tell my students that
you want to pick your collaborators as carefully and thought fully as you
pick your spouse,” he joked to NobelPrize.org. That friendship led to
their most influential contribution, the development of the Local Average
Treatment Effect (LATE) framework.  It offers a rigorous way to estimate
how an intervention—like going to college—
 affects people who experience it only
because of some random circumstance, such as winning a scholarship.
 Today, LATE is a standard tool
for turning messy data into credible insights. Imbens describes it as a way
to focus not on everyone, but specifi cally on the people whose choices are
shifted by an outside force—a law, a rule, or a change in circumstance. Poli
cymakers, for example, use it to assess how the availability—by law—of
gov ernment-paid health insurance at age 65 impacts health care use and
to mea sure the earnings effect of staying in school longer because of
compulsory education laws. In industry, Silicon Valley uses it to evaluate
new features in tech platforms through randomized rollouts. By focusing on
the people whose behavior is nudged by real-world events, LATE has helped
move econom ics from theoretical models to practical, evidence-based policy.
 Imbens credits the foundational
work of statistician Donald Rubin—
 another Harvard colleague and
friend—with helping shape the way he and Angrist thought about causality.
He says the approach built on earlier studies, including Angrist’s collabora
tion with the late Alan Krueger, a pio neering labor economist. Their 1991
paper estimates the causal effect of education on earnings using people’s
quarter of birth and US school-entry laws. That paper “was very influen
tial” for advancing causal economics, Imbens emphasizes. Those early nat ural
experiments laid the groundwork for the credibility revolution in eco nomics
in the 1990s, when research ers began questioning assumptions and insisting
on plausible comparisons.  They began asking, What would have happened if
circumstances had been different? It was an empirical shift that Imbens
helped define with new tools and sharper identification strategies.  Card,
who shared the Nobel with experiments in labor markets, notes that Imbens
occupies a rare middle ground between theory and practice. “I’m more of
a practitioner. He’s more of a meth odology guy. But he’s among the meth
odology people who are most interested in what applied people are doing,”
Card says. Together, their work helps bridge the gap between what is happening
in the world and how we can reliably understand why it’s happening. Imbens
says, “We wanted to make econometrics useful for empirical people in a
way that we thought wasn’t quite there yet.”
 But what Imbens brings to a team is
far more than just intellectual firepower, says Rubin. “He’s just innately
friendly.” He has a calm presence and collegial ity that defuses tension
and brings the focus back to the work, Rubin says. “He has a different
sort of approach to life in many ways.” Curious beginnings
 Imbens was born in 1963 in Geldrop,
in the southern Netherlands. Though his parents were not academics them
selves—and not university graduates when Imbens was young—they nur tured
intellectual exploration. “They stimulated that in us,” Imbens says. His
father gave him and his two siblings math problems to solve for fun. “We
enjoyed doing them,” Imbens remem bers. It sparked his curiosity and love
of logical thinking, skills that would shape his approach to economics years
later.  “So both my siblings and I ended up going to university. In fact,
my brother got a PhD in mathematics.”
 As a boy, Imbens was captivated
by chess, a passion that reflected his love of strategy and analytical thought.
He also inherited a streak of indepen dence—and a touch of stubbornness—
 from his mother, Annie Imbens-Fran
sen, who later in life became a feminist theologian and an author. He remem
bers his mother’s instinct for noncon formity. “We were living in housing
that was owned by Philips,” the multi national Dutch electronics firm where
his father worked. “Once a year they [Philips] would paint the front doors
this vile bright yellow,” Imbens recalls. “My 68

would paint them black. This was a row do work a bit less—helped shift
debates F&D
 and machine learning. “Susan is a very
broad economist… She’s always a source of townhouses. There was one
house with a non-yellow door.”
 After high school, Imbens chose to
attend Erasmus University Rotterdam, where one of his early influences, fellow
Dutch economist and Nobel Prize–win ner Jan Tinbergen, had established an
econometrics program. He then went on to earn a master’s in 1986 at the
University of Hull in the UK, under the mentorship of Anthony Lancaster,
who ultimately persuaded Imbens to follow him to Brown University, where
Imbens received his PhD in 1991. “Getting into Brown for his PhD felt like
winning the lottery for Guido,” says Susan Athey, Imbens’ wife and a
fellow economics professor at Stanford University.
 Lancaster introduced Imbens to
Bayesian econometrics and provided the intellectual tools and, perhaps more
important, the network of connections that helped launch Imbens’ academic
career in the United States.
 After a stint at Harvard, Imbens held
faculty positions at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Berkeley,
and ultimately Stanford, where he now teaches. A landmark use of causal infer
ence occurred when Imbens was at UCLA, in a study with Rubin and Harvard
PhD student Bruce Sacerdote. They used lot tery data to examine how sudden
finan cial windfalls affect people’s work and spending decisions. The
results—show ing that people don’t necessarily quit their jobs after
a windfall but that many of inspiration for the type of problems I around
basic income and pensions while also broadening the reach of causal infer
ence beyond education and health.
 Solving problems Imbens is quick to acknowledge the role
of serendipity in his own life. “I do feel very fortunate. I’ve just
been incredibly lucky to be in the right place at the right time.” Still,
he believes strongly that cultivating meaningful relationships with many
of the leading economists of his generation is as critical to his work as
technical skill, and he places great importance on his role today of men toring
younger scholars. “I’m trying to influence the profession more generally
in a direction that makes sense—where econometricians are working on prob
lems that are important for empirical work,” he says. “I try to instill
that in my students: It’s not always about the math ematics—it’s about
interesting problems.”
 In March 2025, Imbens was named
faculty director of Stanford Data Sci ence, an initiative that supports
research and scholarship through data-driven discovery and data science
education across the campus. He sees the role as a chance to encourage
young research ers, deepen interdisciplinary ties, and bring data science
into closer conversa tion with real-world policy.  Economic collaboration
is never far from home. Imbens’ wife, Athey, is a John Bates Clark Medal
winner who is known for her pioneering work at the intersection of technology,

the way through—and shared the fun,” Athey says, noting that despite his
heavy workload, Imbens leads a very grounded life, biking with col leagues
on weekends, tending to his gar den, having his students over for events,
and when time allows, which is rare these days, preparing memorable meals.
But his most notable achievement is helping to reshape the way economists
think about evidence, policy, and uncer tainty. In doing so, he has brought
clar ity to questions that had once seemed unanswerable and opened the door
for more credible social science. In a field that often rewards certainty,
Imbens has made a career out of working in the messy middle—a place where
data are imperfect and intellectual honesty matters most. That, too, is a
form of ele gance. When the Nobel Prize Museum asked each laureate to donate
an item that was meaningful to their research, Imbens chose a container of
laundry detergent—a quiet tribute to those early mornings spent folding
shirts and trading ideas with Angrist. Few tokens could better capture the

 Café Economics Taxing Matters Stefanie Stantcheva explains how
policymakers can raise taxes without scaring off innovators
 The Internal Revenue Service building in Washington,
DC, has its raison d’être etched in stone across its facade: “Taxes
are what we pay for civilized soci ety.” That quote is from Oliver Wendell
Holmes Jr., a Supreme Court justice in the early 1900s, but some prominent
modern-day Americans, such as Steve Jobs, argue that it is innovation that
truly allows societies to evolve: “Innovation distinguishes between a
leader and a follower,” Jobs said. So what happens when those two things
work against each other...when taxes start to weigh on innovation?
 Stefanie Stantcheva wants to know how tax policy can
make or break the innovative spirit, a subject she studies at Harvard
University’s Social Economics Lab, which she founded. Her fascination with
economics began when she was a young girl growing up in Bulgaria in the 1990s
amid bouts of hyperinfla tion. She later moved to France and East Germany,
where she found more eco nomic puzzles to solve. Stantcheva was destined to
become an economist and has been doing remarkable research ever since.
 Her work on taxation and innova
tion won her the 2025 John Bates Clark Medal—known as the Baby Nobel—
 awarded for the most significant contri
butions to economic thought and knowl edge by an economist under age 40.
Stantcheva’s youthful approach has shed light on trends such as zero-sum
thinking, which challenges conven tional wisdom on growth and, she says,
helps explain the reasoning behind the perception of economic policies among
younger generations.

to go beyond conventional data to understand people’s reasoning, perceptions,
beliefs, and attitudes, Stantcheva tells F&D.
 F&D: You’ve been involved in many
thought-provoking studies, but your work on taxation and innovation has
received a lot of attention. What’s the connection?
 SS: There’s an important connection.
Innovators and inventors are economic agents, like everyone else, and they
care about economic incentives and rewards.  Our studies show the effect of
taxation on inventors in the United States all the way back to the 1930s. We
wanted to understand how taxes shaped the quan tity of innovation, where it
happened across different states, and its quality. We found that taxation
has a negative effect 70

 on innovation, both in terms of the quan
tity, as measured by the number of pat are not new, but your approach is a
lit tle different. Can you explain?
 F&D I must get a smaller slice. It contrasts
with positive-sum thinking—the belief ents, and the location. States with
higher personal—and especially higher corpo rate income taxes—lost out
to lower-in come-tax states in terms of innovation.
 F&D: So if a state wants more innova
tion, more start-ups, all it has to do is lower taxes?
 SS: It’s more complicated, because tax
ation exists for a good reason. We need to raise revenue to finance important
public spending. If a state has a lot of amenities—measured, for instance,
by the number of inventors located there already, or by its research infrastruc
ture—this dampens the effects of higher taxes. California, for example, has
rel atively high taxes. Yet innovators still want to move there because there
is so much innovation there already and because of the many amenities, which
are partly financed by high taxes. And this is also true in other major patent
ing countries, in western Europe and Canada, for instance. Superstar inven tors
are highly mobile and sensitive to taxes. Migration effects are powerful for
highly qualified inventors.  The policy conclusion is that because taxes are
needed for lots of reasons, it’s important to dampen their negative economic
effects. The way revenues are spent is critical. Revenues that foster research
and innovation infrastructure, that make a location attractive, allow a state
or a country to sustain higher taxes without losing all innovative capacity.
 F&D: Taxation is a recurring theme
in your research. What makes it so interesting?
 SS: Who likes taxes, right? But they
affect so many aspects of our lives. A well-designed tax system can encour
age growth and equality and provide great infrastructure and public ser
vices. But a poorly designed tax system can have terrible cascading effects
that hamper economic development. Tax ation is such a powerful tool that
it’s important to study it and get it right.
 F&D: One thing that sets your research
apart is the way you use surveys, which SS: Surveys have been around for
a very long time in economics, but there are things that remain completely
invisible in data, no matter how good it is—things like people’s reasoning,
perceptions, beliefs, attitudes. This is why the surveys we do at the Social
Economics Lab are so important. We try to understand how people think about
economic issues and economic policies. We go deep into how people reason,
why they reason the way they do, why they hold some views and not others. Our
surveys also typically incorporate something experimen tal, which means some
people will see one type of information while oth ers will see another. We
can see what happens from that additional informa tion or that different
angle on an issue.  We’re creating big data on something unusual: what’s
happening in people’s minds. We can analyze it in a quanti tative way. We
can see patterns and understand cause and effect. We can draw many lessons
from this.  F&D: Can you give an example?
 SS: We tried to see how people in 20
countries feel about major climate policies. An interesting example is the
trade-off between taxing pollution and banning it altogether. Should we tax
pol luting cars and still let people purchase them if they’re willing to
pay the price?  Or should we ban polluting cars alto gether? Economic theory
suggests that a tax is more efficient than an outright ban. But people feel
differently, and our surveys help us understand why. And it turns out people
are driven by a strong equity concern. People find it unfair that the rich
can simply pay to pollute while others cannot. They consider an out right
ban to be fairer.
 F&D: And your other study suggests
more people are thinking in zero-sum terms. What’s that about?
 SS: Zero-sum thinking is the belief
that if one individual or group gains, it must come at the expense of another.
It’s the belief in a limited amount of good. If you get a larger slice of the
pie, that we can grow the pie and don’t need to be in direct competition with
each other. We set out to study how this mindset is spread across the US—
 across different groups, different gen
erations, different places—and where it comes from and how it shapes pol
icy views. Zero-sum thinking, it turns out, is much more prevalent among
younger people in the US. That might seem surprising, but it’s also true
in other rich countries. The economic environment really matters. People
who grew up in a time of lower growth and lower mobility, as is the case
for younger generations in the US, are much more likely to be zero-sum.
 The pattern is flipped in emerg
ing market economies, where there is higher growth and higher mobility than
before. Younger generations in these countries are less zero-sum than the older
ones. But the economic environ ment also matters at the individual level.
So if your own family has experienced upward mobility, then you are less
likely to be zero-sum.
 F&D: Do you see this further politiciz
ing economic policy debates?
 SS: What’s interesting about zero-sum
thinking is that, unlike so many other things today, it’s not a partisan
issue: It’s evenly distributed across both sides of the political
divide. It’s not the case that one political group is more zero sum than the
other. It does, however, explain a lot of within-party variation in policy
views. People who are more zero sum, for instance, want more govern ment
intervention to protect the group that’s suffering from the zero-sum sit
uation. People who are more zero-sum support more redistribution, driven by
the idea that the gains of the rich come at the expense of the poor. It’s
interest ing to think about this in light of younger generations today being
more zero-sum.  What might this mean for policies in the future? F&D

 FALSE DAWN: The
New Deal and the Promise of Recovery, 1933–1947
 George Selgin University of
Chicago Press
 Chicago,IL,
2025, 384 pp., $35 us president Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal projects
and regulations were so wide-ranging in their aims and scope that it’s
hard to reach a simple verdict on their effectiveness.  George Selgin
rightly avoids attempting to do so in False Dawn, his new book examining
the administration’s 1933–39 policies and the recovery from the Great
Depression.  Selgin, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute’s Center for
Mon etary and Financial Alternatives and economics professor emer itus at the
University of Georgia, challenges the idea that the New Deal was a coherent
plan that Roosevelt designed before taking office. Rather, key components
were cobbled together after his inauguration, often without Roosevelt’s
initial support.  Selgin takes on these components one by one, from the
1933 bank holiday and the gold programs to the alphabet soup of agencies,
including the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor poration (FDIC), the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation (RFC), the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA),
the National Recovery Administration (NRA), and the Home Owners’ Loan
Corporation (HOLC).  In these chapters, Selgin describes the conventional wis
dom about some aspects of the New Deal, the challenges to the conventional
wisdom, and the challenges to the challenges.  He evaluates the literature
and his own read of the historical record. By the end of each chapter, we
know exactly where he stands, how firmly, and on what strength of evidence.
Selgin pinpoints where evidence is shaky or missing, mak ing the book a
treasure trove of research ideas for economic historians. For example, he
also points to a need for improved empirical studies estimating the effects
of policy uncertainty on investment—an especially important topic today,
with some measures of economic policy uncertainty at record highs.  For a more
general audience, the book’s most important contribution is its debunking
of what Selgin calls the “Keynes ian myth,” or “popular tendency
to identify the New Deal with Keynesian economics,” which has “had an
unfortunate effect on discourses concerning the merits of each.” Selgin
cites Eric Rauchway’s 2015 book The Money Makers as Keynesian myth making,
specifically its assertion that Roosevelt “conducted an active monetary
and fiscal program of recovery…working along lines suggested by Keynes.”
Selgin shows that Roosevelt was not influenced by Keynes. He was firmly
committed to fiscal conservatism until after 1937, and the Federal Reserve
did not deliberately use monetary stimu lus in response to the Depression.
 Perhaps even more important than
the decidedly un-Keynesian mone tary and fiscal policy was Roosevelt’s
disregard for Keynes’s warnings about expectations. Keynes recognized
that Roosevelt’s antibusiness attitude and various New Deal policies,
especially the National Industrial Recovery Act, were breeding fear and
uncertainty and precluded the possibility of an invest ment-led recovery.
Business leaders shared Keynes’s sense that the policy uncertainty gener
ated by the New Deal was highly coun terproductive. Selgin quotes Lammot du
Pont II, president of the chemical com pany Dupont, who remarked in 1937 that
“uncertainty rules the tax situation, the labor situation, the monetary
situation and practically every legal condition under which industry must
operate…The whole future is a gigantic question mark.” Selgin explains
that “it isn’t simply bad outcomes that frighten investors; it’s also
not knowing what’s in store.” F&D

 Hope despite Hostility Elizabeth Van Heuvelen F&D “Trade during wartime
was once considered a nonstarter because it was seen as contributing to
military capability.”
 in trade in war, Mariya Grinberg probes a fundamen
tal question: Why do warring countries trade with each other?  Grinberg,
a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
posits both economic and security imperatives. In short, countries allow as
much wartime trade as makes military sense and prohibit as much militarily
dan gerous trade as is economically viable. A series of case stud ies
follow—spanning the Crimean War, both world wars, and the post–Cold War
era—during which wartime trade “should have been least likely.”
 It may seem evident that warring countries can maintain
some kind of commercial relationship, but Grinberg reminds us that this was
not always true. A striking section of the book examines the introduction
of “neutral rights” during the Crimean War, which caused a fundamental
shift in thinking about trade during war: Nuanced trade policy can replace
the extreme practice of severing all trade.
 Trade during wartime was once considered a nonstarter
because it was seen as contributing to military capability.  Grinberg explains
that after the onset of the Crimean War, and by complete happenstance, a large
amount of produce already paid for by France got stuck in Russian ports because
of late-melting ice in the Baltic Sea. These circumstances opened the way for
France to persuade Britain and Russia to allow the shipment through despite
the ongoing war. This led to a dec laration on the rights of neutrals and
eventual adoption of the Declaration of Paris, which codified such practices
through subsequent conflicts, allowing trade to continue and, more important,
shifting perceptions of the acceptability of trade during conflict.
 Building on this historical foundation of neutral rights,
Grinberg demonstrates how states developed more sophis ticated frameworks for
wartime trade decisions. She empha sizes the importance of the “conversion
time” of trade prod ucts into military capability and the revenue generated
by these trades. This helps determine wartime commercial decisions by weighing
immediate military benefits against long-term economic costs. The case study

 shows how Britain and Germany fre
quently adjusted their commercial policies as the war progressed and their
expectations about the conflict’s duration and stakes changed. Britain’s
initial lax policy, based on the antici pation of a short war, tightened as the
war dragged on. Germany, in contrast, went on to make more dire predictions
about the stakes of the war and imple mented an even more prohibitive pol
icy, but ultimately allowed for more trade once it became clear the conflict
would be protracted.
 The book ends with a look at more
modern conflicts and whether states resolve the trade-off between eco
nomic and security imperatives in the same way without the pressures of war.
Strategic calculations are complicated in today’s global economy, she argues,
particularly given global value chains and economic interdependence of major
trading partners. Yet, according to Grinberg’s understanding of wartime
trade, this also suggests that decoupling in these circumstances is highly
unlikely even amid heightened tension. This should come as no surprise given
a key through line of the book: Economic cooperation can thrive even in the
most hostile times. F&D

 Book Reviews History’s Earliest
Hustlers
 Nicholas Owen “the history of rome,” writes US archaeologist Kim
Bowes, “is peopled by the rich.” Cicero, Livy, and Tacitus chronicled the
lives of consuls and emperors, but the classical world’s most celebrated
scholars weren’t interested in ordinary working Romans. It’s an omission
Bowes seeks to remedy in her remarkable and meticulously researched new book,
Sur viving Rome: The Economic Lives of the Ninety Percent.
 We meet a colorful cast of characters who survived—and
sometimes even thrived—in what the author describes as the world’s first
“global” economy. The challenges faced by ancient Egypt’s Soterichos
family, who turned to cash crops to pay off debt, shed light on smallholder
agriculture. We learn how Romans accessed credit in times of want from stories
of the Pompeian pawnbroker and moneylender Faustilla. And the dealings of army
supplier Philokles, who pimped out prostitutes to a garrison at Krokodilo
in Egypt’s Eastern Desert, form part of a discussion of income earned by
working for the Roman state.  Bowes, a professor of classical studies at the
University of Pennsylvania and former director of the American Academy in
Rome, rejects the notion that all premodern societies were essentially the
same—that it’s possible to fill gaps in our knowl edge of the ancient
world by retrojecting based on peoples and places we know better. She draws
instead on archaeological discoveries, bookkeeping records, and even human
skeletons from far corners of the empire. The economy that emerges from
these sources—many of which have surfaced or been sub ject to rigorous
scientific analysis only in the past 20 years—is far more complex than
hitherto supposed.
 At the heart of this economy was a paradox: high con
sumption and rapidly expanding demand for cheap consumer goods—from
greater varieties of food and drink to highly stan dardized pots, jugs,
and jewelry—combined with low income and limited opportunities to earn a
wage. Romans dealt with this income gap and supported themselves during months
of scarcity through credit, pawning possessions, or borrowing against the
next harvest or another source of future income.  Social mobility depended
on accumulating small amounts of capital that could generate additional
income—a plot of “Bowes does not shy away from comparisons with the
precarious economic existence of many people today.”

 farmland, a yoke of oxen, a pottery kiln,
or a loom for weaving. Yet most families struggled to amass savings to
transform into capital.
 Neat analytical categories such as
farmer, artisan, or wage laborer fall apart on contact with the messy real
ity of ordinary Romans who depended on a multitude of income sources to make
ends meet. Distinctions between adult and child, rural and urban, cred itor
and debtor—even between free and enslaved—become blurred when it comes
to ordinary lives.
 Bowes does not shy away from
comparisons with the precarious eco nomic existence of many people today.
The relentless persistence of working Romans who “squeezed a living out
of their circumstances” through graft, hustles, and money maneuvers is
not so different from the efforts of a wide swath of 21st century American
society, Bowes writes. Discussions of modern economic thinkers, from Adam
Smith and Karl Marx to John Kenneth Gal braith and Thomas Piketty, add con
temporary resonance.
 Bowes’s lively storytelling, accom
panied by dozens of illustrations and photographs, will interest specialist
and general readers alike. “It’s amaz ing,” Bowes writes, “how much
we can know about the 90 percent just by lis tening to them.” F&D

 F&D F  D Slug Currency Notes Tradition and Technology Jeff Kearns and
 Melinda Weir Bermuda’s new notes honor history with more
durable, accessible, and sustainable design
 bermuda’s first coins, minted around 1616, were
“hogge money.” They featured a galleon on one side and a hog on the other,
a nod to free-roaming swine descended from those abandoned by Spanish and
Portuguese mariners—and which, a century later, were a source of sustenance
for shipwrecked English sailors. The poor-quality money, however, was aban
doned after a few years when tobacco became the local currency.  Today,
modern money in the British overseas territory continues to highlight the
Atlantic archipelago’s unique flora, fauna, and landscape. These themes,
consistent across issu ance since the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) was
cre ated in 1969, make its notes and coins prized by collectors and praised
for their design.
 The BMA introduced its new $2 and $5 banknotes last year— the lowest
 denominations of the Bermuda dollar. The currency
has been pegged to the US dollar since 1972, and both circulate
interchangeably. The updates, which largely keep the origi nal appearance,
will be followed by changes for $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills.  Bermuda’s
pink $5 bill won the Banknote of the Year award from the International Bank
Note Society, which cited its high tech security measures and “colorful,
eye-pleasing design.” The industry group High Security Printing Latin
America named the $2 and $5 best new 2025 notes.
 The $5 notes show a blue marlin, Horseshoe Bay Beach,
and Somerset Bridge—a short early 1600s span known as the world’s smallest
drawbridge. Its wood plank, less than a meter wide, can be raised to let the
masts of sailboats pass through.  The $2 bill shows a Bermuda bluebird and
two historical icons of the territory’s role as a Royal Navy base for centu
ries: the Dockyard clock tower and the statue of Neptune. Both notes show the
new head of state, King Charles III, in his first appearance on the currency.
The notes also share important design elements the mon etary authority calls a
significant step toward greater durabil ity and security. They are Bermuda’s
first printed on polymer substrate, a thin plastic that’s easier to keep
clean than cotton and is expected to circulate more than twice as long. In
addition, visually impaired users can identify the notes by their embossed 76
