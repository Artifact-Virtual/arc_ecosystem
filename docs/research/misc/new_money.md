# The New Money Layer: Five Insights into the Future of Stablecoins

*Photo by Rachael Rinchiuso Kearney, Chicago*

Digital assets are emerging from a retail novelty to the financial
infrastructure of the future. The trajectory is clear, and
stablecoins—fiat-pegged digital currencies—are at the forefront of
this revolution.
 Distributed ledger technology has been generating
headlines for more than a decade, even though there have been a limited number
of use cases. But now, that’s poised to change. Stablecoins—blockchain
based tokens issued by regulated private entities—
 could take digital assets into the financial and
corporate mainstream.  Figure 1
 Stablecoins’ value is typically pegged to a
government-issued currency, most commonly the US dollar. Unlike
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, Stablecoin’s price stability is
maintained by private issuers that hold equivalent reserves in highly liquid,
low-risk assets, often short-term US Treasuries or cash. Stablecoins are
distinct from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which are legal tender
of money issued directly by central banks.  Unlike other cryptocurrencies,
stablecoins offer a unique combination of open interoperability, settlement
flexibility, and integration with decentralized ecosystems—features that
position stablecoins as a foundational layer for programmable, instant-value
exchange (see figure 1).

The features of stablecoin
 One key feature of stablecoins is atomic settlement,
which allows for real-time finality without counterparty risk. Delays
and reconciliation issues in traditional settlement are estimated to cost
financial institutions up to $15 billion a year in lost liquidity, failed
trades, and operational inefficiencies.
 Stablecoins can also dramatically reduce transaction
costs. In 2023, global remittance fees averaged 6.2 percent, reaching even
higher in parts of Africa and South Asia. Cross-border interbank wires
often incur charges of between $20 and $80, not including hidden foreign
exchange (FX) markups. Conversely, stablecoin transaction fees on scalable
blockchains can be as low as a few cents, making them particularly compelling
for international money flows that require several intermediaries, which
can drive up costs.
 In addition, each stablecoin movement is publicly
recorded and auditable in real time, enabling transaction transparency and
traceability to support robust compliance, anti-money laundering efforts,
and cross-border regulatory monitoring. This contrasts sharply with the
opacity of legacy correspondent banking chains. Institutions can also layer
additional compliance protocols into on-chain transactions, including address
screening and geofencing, ensuring alignment with local and international
regulatory frameworks.
 The programmability of stablecoins is perhaps most
transformative. Unlike static money formats, stablecoins can be integrated
with smart contracts that embed conditional logic, unlocking new automation
capabilities for treasury, payments, and capital markets. In trade finance,
for example, funds can be released automatically upon confirmation of goods
shipment. In treasury, stablecoins allow CFOs to program automatic liquidity
rebalancing across subsidiaries. In insurance, parametric policies can use
oracles to trigger payouts autonomously, cutting down on processing delays
and disputes.
 These advantages are fueling a surge of stablecoin
adoptions. Payment giants such as Visa and Mastercard are piloting stablecoin
settlement rails; banks such as JPMorgan, BBVA, and Santander have announced
plans to issue their own stablecoin; and payment service providers (PSPs)
such as PayPal and Stripe are integrating stablecoins into their core suite of
services. These developments reflect a broader shift, as stablecoins evolve
from retail novelty to institutional-grade financial instruments.  To shed
light on this shifting landscape, we offer five insights into the future of
stablecoins and how they could shape the next era of financial infrastructure.

 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
1. Stablecoins go institutional in 2025
 After more than a decade of experimentation and
volatility, stablecoins are entering a new phase of maturity defined by
large-scale institutional engagement. As of mid-2025, the total stablecoin
market capitalization has surpassed $ 250 billion, with annual on-chain
transaction volumes exceeding $25 trillion, placing stablecoins on par or
above some of the world’s largest global payment networks. In comparison,
Visa and Mastercard process $15 trillion and $10 trillion a year respectively,
and it took them more than 50 years to reach those levels. Stablecoin’s
rapid scale-up of real economic activity reflects not only technological
readiness but also institutional stakeholders’ shifting attitudes.
 Figure 2 A wave of strategic moves by financial and
technology heavyweights over the past 12 months signals a structural shift
in the adoption curve (see figure 2). Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge and
Privy, two key players in the wallet and digital identity space, demonstrates
a commitment to integrating stablecoin infrastructure natively into commerce
platforms.  Worldpay’s partnership with BVNK enables global payouts across
more than 180 markets. Meanwhile, Circle’s IPO success underscores long-run
market expectations around the institutional monetization of stablecoins
and the expansion of regulated, fiat backed issuance. These moves reflect
a consensus that’s forming across capital markets, payment providers,
and technology platforms: the stablecoin thesis has moved from speculative
to strategic.
 As a result, rather than questioning the relevance of
stablecoins, financial institutions are exploring how they can be used,
monetized, and integrated into their core infrastructure. Banks are evaluating
stablecoins for wholesale settlement, cash management, and cross-border
payment solutions.  Fintechs are embedding them into retail wallets and B2B
platforms. And PSPs are exploring them as a lower-cost alternative to card
rails, particularly in underbanked or high-fee markets.

 insights into the future of stablecoins
What makes 2025 pivotal is not only the scale of capital and transactional
volume, but also the alignment of infrastructure, regulation, and market
readiness. Jurisdictions such as the UAE, Singapore, the UK, the EU, and now
the United States already give issuers licensing paths, capital thresholds,
and disclosure duties. July 2025 added a global linchpin: the US GENIUS
Act, which for the first time creates a harmonized federal set of rules
for US dollar-pegged stablecoins. By mandating onshore issuance, audited
cash-and-T-bill reserves, and quarterly reporting, it delivers clarity,
unlocks a safer innovation runway for banks and fintechs, and further
entrenches US-dollar primacy in digital finance.
 Figure 3 2. Payments power the
next wave of adoption
 So far, stablecoins have mostly been used in crypto
native environments, namely for trading on centralized and decentralized
exchanges. Trading still accounts for more than 95 percent of global stablecoin
transaction volumes, creating the perception that stablecoins are niche
financial instruments tied to speculative crypto activity.  However, this
narrative is shifting: payments are now the fastest-growing application of
stablecoins, thanks to the convergence of infrastructure maturity, corporate
interest, and clear value propositions in real-world financial flows (see
figure 3).
 Payments are emerging as the fastest-growing application for stablecoin

 Each of these use cases addresses a specific unmet
need in the payments landscape, particularly in cross-border contexts where
settlement is slow, costs are high, and intermediaries restrict transparency.
Addressing the pain points has fueled rapid adoption and is leading a growing
number of fintechs to develop stablecoin-based products (see figure 4).
 Stablecoins are increasingly being used to facilitate
four high-impact payment use cases:

 5 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
One nascent use case that’s poised for explosive growth is agentic commerce
that combines the power of stablecoins and AI. Although adoption in e-commerce
is still in its infancy, many leading platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and
Shopify have all announced plans to integrate stablecoins. Coinbase recently
announced the release of the x402 protocol, which introduces a powerful enabler
for agentic payments. The protocol allows for direct stablecoin transactions
from user wallets to merchants without intermediaries or third-party checkout
systems. This unlocks a new paradigm, which is particularly relevant for
autonomous AI agents that conduct transactions on behalf of users or systems,
such as restocking inventory, paying for SaaS, or purchasing datasets.
 Figure 5 3. Distribution is the
engine of value creation In a simplified form, the stablecoin value chain
consists of four interdependent roles (see figure 5).  While stablecoin
issuers such as Circle and Tether have grown their revenue by minting tokens
and earning yield on the outstanding float, the value capture is moving
upstream toward distribution.  These are the players with the trusted user
interface, regulatory licenses, and financial products that wrap stablecoins
in practical use cases that are ultimately making them mainstream. Although
any company can issue a stablecoin, an emerging strategic play is to partner
with trusted issuers and orchestrators to focus on customer acquisition,
product innovation, and user engagement.  Value capture is moving upstream
through four roles in the stablecoin value chain

4. Local stablecoins will unlock more use cases
 Although US dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDT
still dominate the market, collectively accounting for more than 95 percent
of circulating stablecoin value, non-US-dollar stablecoins are emerging as
critical enablers of domestic and regional payments. In many jurisdictions,
including the UAE, Singapore, the EU, and Hong Kong, regulatory clarity,
monetary stability, and high trade interconnectivity are creating fertile
ground for stablecoin innovation beyond the dollar (see figure 6).
 We are already seeing this play out in the market.
Rather than issue its own stablecoin, NuBank, Latin America’s largest
digital bank, allows its more than 90 million users to hold US dollar-backed
stablecoins, earn yield, and make cross-border payments, all wrapped in a
trusted banking app. Issuers are also adapting to this new reality. Circle’s
launch of the Circle Payments Network signals a pivot from issuer to full-stack
payments platform, an attempt to extend beyond treasury reserves management
and capture downstream value. This presents a sizable opportunity for
financial institutions and PSPs to enter the emerging digital assets space
by leveraging their existing client base and distribution while limiting
investments and shortening the time to market.

 Key beneits: Regulatory clarity: establishes a clear, uniform set of rules

 On-shore issuance: requires major stablecoin operators to
domicile, hold reserves, and report under US jurisdiction (a direct answer
to offshore players such as Tether)
 Innovation runway: gives intechs and banks a predictable
framework to safely launch new digital asset products
 US dollar primacy: anchors the growing stablecoin market
to US dollar reserves, reinforcing the dollar’s role as the world’s
reserve currency
 7 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
This shift is both inevitable and necessary. Although still the dominant
currency in global trade and capital markets, the US dollar’s use in
regional or domestic payments often introduces unwanted FX exposure, legal
complexity, and operational friction. For example, a non-US business paying
its suppliers in the same country in US dollars still incurs FX spreads and
regulatory compliance burdens, even when both parties transact in the same
native currency. Non-US dollar stablecoins eliminate this inefficiency,
enabling near-instant, local-currency digital payments with the same
programmability and composability as their dollar-backed counterparts. In
the case of regional trade, this can be particularly relevant for corridors
with high-volume cross-border flows, such as between the Middle East and
the Indian subcontinent.
 As stablecoins gain traction, they can also facilitate the
formation of on-chain FX markets, allowing entities to swap digital
currencies programmatically and at a lower cost. Unlike today’s fragmented
FX ecosystem, where spreads, intermediaries, and delays inflate costs, an
on-chain FX market using stablecoins could offer real-time, transparent,
and disintermediated currency exchange, a major benefit for corporations,
treasurers, and cross-border platforms.
 Regulatory clarity is proving to be the primary catalyst
for this evolution. The jurisdictions moving fastest to define stablecoin rules
are already attracting issuers, orchestrators, and financial institutions
eager to experiment and scale. A case in point is the UAE, which in June
2024 issued its Payment Token Services Regulation, the first comprehensive
framework in the Middle East for regulating local fiat-referenced tokens
(stablecoins). Issuers must be licensed and meet strict reserve, redemption,
and reporting standards, creating a clear legal path for both bank-issued and
fintech-issued stablecoins.  Singapore’s Project Orchid, the EU’s Markets
in Crypto-Assets Regulation, and Hong Kong’s upcoming stablecoin licensing
regime reflect similar momentum toward formalizing stablecoin activities
under financial supervision. The United States, India, Saudi Arabia,
and many other countries are expected to follow suit in the coming year.
As regional stablecoins proliferate, use cases will expand into treasury,
trade finance, and other key verticals that can benefit from low-cost and
real-time settlement. For PSPs, banks, and corporations, this opens the door
to more localized, efficient, and compliant payment models that reduce reliance
on the US dollar, especially where it adds complexity without adding value.
 5. Stablecoins will grow
10x but are not a one-size fits-all solution
 The trajectory for stablecoins is exponential rather
than linear. Over the next several years, stablecoins are poised to grow 10x
in market capitalization, fueled by deeper integration across major financial
and payment platforms and growing institutional acceptance. What was once
a fringe innovation confined to crypto exchanges is now rapidly becoming a
core component of global financial infrastructure.
 Two interlocking forces are fueling this acceleration: —Distribution
 scale. Mainstream PSPs such as Visa,
Mastercard, Worldpay, and Stripe are rolling out stablecoin-based
settlement and payout capabilities, integrating stablecoins as live rails
for cross-border payments, merchant settlement, and treasury disbursement.
—Institutional trust. Traditional financial institutions are entering
the stablecoin economy, either by issuing their own fiat-backed tokens
(for example, JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, and Société Générale’s EURCV)
or integrating regulated third-party stablecoins into client offerings.  8
 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
These dual entry points are creating the conditions for stablecoins to evolve
from a $250 billion market to a multitrillion-dollar asset class over the
next few years. However, stablecoins are not a one-size-fits-all solution,
and they won’t replace traditional rails across the board. Adoption
will be selective and complementary, depending on the specific use case.
For example, in many low-value domestic transactions, instant payment networks
are still more efficient and cost-effective than on-chain payments, especially
where interoperability and fee structures have already been optimized. In
large-value or interbank settlement scenarios, CBDCs and tokenized deposits
may offer stronger central bank guarantees and more familiar regulatory
frameworks. In other words, stablecoins will coexist, not compete, with a
spectrum of digital and legacy payment systems.  That being said, their
programmability and composability are more than a technical upgrade and
could unlock new financial primitives and use cases.
 Figure 7 A four-pronged decision
making framework More than a technological evolution, stablecoins represent a
fundamental shift in the way value is stored, transferred, and monetized across
financial systems. As this new money layer gains traction, forward-thinking
organizations across banking, payments, and capital markets are redefining
their digital asset management strategies to explore stablecoins as a new
payment rail, a tool for treasury innovation, or an enabler for agentic
commerce.  Common success factors include focusing on use cases that address
real customer needs, seamless integration into existing systems, and diligent
implementation in a multi-stakeholder environment.  Our decision-making
framework addresses four core components of an effective stablecoin offering
(see figure 7).

 9 The new money layer: five insights into the future of stablecoins
In this expansive landscape of opportunities, forward thinking organizations
are recognizing and planning for the associated risks. Our balanced,
risk-aware approach to stablecoin implementation helps companies pull the
right governance, controls, and mitigation levers:
 Custody risk. Choosing between custodial versus
non-custodial models requires making some trade offs in user control,
regulatory exposure, and cyber risk. Custody design must account for wallet
security, key management, and user protection, especially in light of past
breaches.
 Instant settlement and reversibility. The atomic
nature of stablecoin transactions introduces challenges around fraud,
chargebacks, and dispute resolution. Real-time fraud monitoring and
transaction-level conditionality will be essential to protecting consumers.
 Tools for compliance, anti-money laundering (AML)
and know your customer (KYC). Given the pseudo anonymity and decentralized
nature of cryptocurrencies, stablecoin participants must adopt the required
AML/KYC tools to prevent money laundering and ensure regulatory compliance.
Stablecoins have claimed their space in the global payments landscape.
 Charting the way into the
future of payments
 Stablecoins have claimed their space in the global
payments landscape, and it’s clear they are here to stay. PayPal is pushing
PYUSD onto Stellar to power e-commerce and remittance flows; Société
Générale’s USD CoinVertible will be the first US dollar-pegged token from
a G-SIB bank; Mitsubishi UFJ is preparing a yen coin under Japan’s new
stable-asset statute; Standard Chartered and partners are vying to mint an
HK-dollar stablecoin under Hong Kong’s VASP regime; and Australia’s ANZ
is already using A$DC in cross border pilots across Asia Pacific. What’s
fueling this “stablecoin goldrush” is the convergence of clearer rulebooks;
merchants demanding sub-second, low-fee settlement; and banks and tech giants
scrambling to defend payments revenue. For decision-makers, the message is
clear: move now or lose out on the next generation of money.
 Navigating the stablecoin landscape demands not
only technical literacy but strategic clarity and operational foresight. At
Kearney, we combine deep financial expertise, hands-on digital fluency, and a
global ecosystem view to help our clients lead in this next wave of innovation.
