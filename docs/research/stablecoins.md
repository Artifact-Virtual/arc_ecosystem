Technology, Payments,  
and the Rise of Stablecoins 
three years ago, Finance & Development devoted a 
full issue to anticipating “The Money Revolution,” driven 
by innovations in finance, such as crypto assets. That rev
olution is now unfolding.
 This issue of F&D looks at the new frontiers of finance, 
where technology, data, and changing societal values are 
reshaping how people and institutions move money and 
trade financial assets, who provides liquidity, and where 
new risks are brewing. We bring together academics 
and policymakers to assess this complex and politically 
charged landscape, one that generates excitement and 
anxiety in equal measure.
 Stablecoins are one of these frontiers, a form of digital 
asset backed by currencies or government bonds. Stablecoin 
companies have racked up millions of users globally, trans
acting across borders 24/7 at very low cost. New legislation 
in the US and other countries may further boost their growth. 
Hélène Rey, a professor at the London Business School, 
assesses the macroeconomic and geopolitical implica
tions of widespread adoption of US dollar–denominated 
stablecoins around the world. On the positive side: faster 
and cheaper cross-border payments. On the negative: risk 
of dollarization, capital flows and exchange rate volatil
ity, potential weakening of the banking system, money 
laundering and other financial crimes. While it’s hard to 
forecast how the use of this technology will play out, it’s 
“likely to create major financial stability risks,” she writes.
 Yao Zeng of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton 
School identifies one potential source of risk: “The global 
f
 inancial landscape has changed, yet the rules remain 
largely unchanged.” He puts stablecoins in the context 
of broader changes in financial markets. For example, 
lightly regulated nonbanks are providing more liquidity. 
And lenders are increasingly relying on AI and big data to 
speed loan approvals, reduce collateral requirements, and 
reach borrowers traditional banks often overlook. One 
thing is clear, he writes. “Stablecoins may function well 
in good times, but they can falter under stress.” 
Stablecoins are only one facet of the revolution. The 
public and the private sector alike are driving innovation. 
Some governments and central banks have responded 
to private payment initiatives by sponsoring systems

like fintechs and 
big techs, and

institutions.”
 that respond to consumer demand for 
fast, efficient payments. IMF research
ers examine the case of India’s Unified 
Payments Interface, which intercon
nects hundreds of banks, platforms, and 
apps and carries out more than 19 billion 
transactions a month.
 At the same time, central banks and 
supervisors must contend with disrup
tive innovation. New entrants like fin
techs and big techs, and new products 
like crypto and stablecoins, are chal
lenging incumbent financial institutions. 
Iñaki Aldasoro, Jon Frost, and Vatsala 
Shreeti, from the Bank for International 
Settlements, explore how competition 
among the new entrants and incum
bents might unfold. They conclude that 
forward-looking public policies must 
accompany radical innovation to achieve 
the most impactful breakthroughs.
 Preventing crime is another area in 
which public authorities need to stay 
alert. Criminals, unfortunately, were 
among the earliest adopters of crypto, 
and all payment systems need to bal
ance privacy and speed with the need to 
stop tax evasion, money laundering, and 
terrorism financing. Stanford’s Darrell 
Duffie and coauthors lay out a practical 
approach to getting ahead of the curve.
 Clearly, there is a lot of room for 
innovation in payment systems and 
financial markets in general. Users 
demand it. The key is to balance the 
risks and benefits through clear regula
tion that protects consumers and inves
tors and limits spillovers. Who knows 
what new possibilities such innovations 
will unlock along the way? F&D

 “ Financial conditions 
have eased, but 
they could tighten 
abruptly, especially 
in the case of 
threats to central 
bank independence.”
 global growth is projected at 3.0 
percent for 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026, 
according to the IMF’s July 2025 World 
Economic Outlook Update. This upward 
revision from the April forecast reflects 
front-loading in anticipation of higher 
tariffs, lower effective tariff rates, easier 
financial conditions, and fiscal expansion 
in some major economies.
 Global inflation is expected to fall, but 
US inflation is predicted to stay above tar
get, the flagship report notes. Downside 
risks from potentially higher tariffs, ele
vated uncertainty, and geopolitical ten
sions persist.
 Restoring confidence, predictability, 
and sustainability remains a key policy 
priority, according to the report.
 Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s 
economic counsellor and Research 
Department director, noted that “projec
tions remain about 0.2 percentage points 
below our pre-April forecasts, indicating 
that the trade tensions are hurting the 
global economy.”
 “A breakdown in trade talks, or renewed 
protectionism, could dampen growth 
globally and fuel inflation in some coun
tries,” Gourinchas said. However, he 
added that “on the upside, breakthroughs 
in trade negotiations could boost confi
dence, and structural reforms could lift 
long-term productivity.”

Tokens Are Finance’s Newest 
and Oldest Innovation
 Money has taken many forms over millennia;

 thousands of years ago, long 
before coins, paper money, credit cards, 
and banking apps, our ancestors bought 
and sold goods using cowries, a type of 
seashell. These shiny physical tokens 
were humankind’s first financial innova
tion. What made them especially useful 
was that they were easy to verify: When 
someone handed you a cowrie shell, you 
could see it, feel it, and trust that it had 
value. You didn’t need a middleman to 
verify the transaction.
 Cash still works this way today. 
When you pay someone with a banknote, 
the deal is done—no delays. But when 
it comes to digital transactions, pay
ments only seem instant. Behind the 
scenes, banks and credit card networks 
take over as intermediaries, approving 
and settling the transaction later. They 
take on the settlement risk—the danger 
that one party will renege on its end of 
the bargain. Intermediaries ensure that 
both parties keep their promises.
 It takes time to manage settlement 
risk through intermediaries. This mat
ters in cases where settlement delays are 
costly, especially when trading stocks, 
bonds, or other securities in financial 
markets. A clearinghouse collects the 
seller’s asset and the buyer’s payment 
and exchanges them one or two days 
later. In places like Wall Street, time 
is money. J.P. Morgan estimates that 
asset management costs could be cut by 
about a fifth if the settlement of trades 
and the reinvestment of sale proceeds 
were immediate.
 Financial innovators aim to cut inter
mediation costs by bringing the imme
diacy of exchanging physical tokens to 
the digital world. The challenge is that 
when transacting parties don’t meet 
face-to-face, they cannot see the assets 
they are trading before completing an 
exchange. Programmability provides a 
solution—a piece of code that ensures 
the buyer’s money and the seller’s asset 
are locked in and then exchanged at the 
same moment. The funds received can 
be reinvested automatically, saving 
valuable time and money.
 Digital intermediaries
 Tokenization creates assets on a pro
grammable ledger, a recordkeeping 
system for financial transactions that 
market participants can trust and 
share access to. Assets such as a stock 
or bond can be issued directly on the 
ledger, or they might be a representa
tion of an asset that exists outside the 
ledger, such as stock on the New York 
Stock Exchange. In the latter case, an 
intermediary still needs to hold the rep
resented asset safely in the background.
 Tokenization can spur competition 
between intermediaries. To trade in 
f
 inancial markets, investors are often 
required by regulation to use brokers. 
Switching assets from one broker to 
another is a hassle that requires the 
services of a specialized clearinghouse. 
Alternatively, an investor can sell all 
assets owned through one broker and 
repurchase them through another, but 
that comes with a trading cost. Tokeni
zation, however, allows data to be trans
ferred among brokers with the click of a 
button. It makes it simpler for investors 
to shop around and switch between bro
kers for the best price.
 Tokenization does not cut out all 
middlemen, but it is reshaping the 
financial industry and reducing the 
need for certain roles. Registrars are 
intermediaries that manage asset own
ership records and transmit payments

 backed by mortgages no lender would 
have signed 20 years earlier, were the 
f
 irst dominoes to fall in the financial sec
tor,” it says. Programmability adds to an 
already complex financial landscape 
and makes it harder for regulators to 
keep tabs on potential risks.
 How much debt participants in a 
financial market owe each other has 
often made the difference between a 
financial ripple and a tsunami. Debt 
amplifies shocks because it implies a 
promise to repay—and nothing rocks 
confidence like broken repayment prom
ises. Tokenization can make it easier to 
such as dividends or interest from a firm 
to the asset owners. On a token ledger 
such payments are made directly to the 
token holders, automating the role of 
registrars and putting them out of a job. 
Tokenization works best when 
money and assets flow smoothly. If dif
ferent companies build their own token 
ledgers that don’t work together, the 
f
 inancial system could fragment into 
silos. It is possible to design ledgers so 
that they can talk to each other, but this 
interoperability requires planning and 
coordination. This is why policymakers 
want to make sure that tokenized sys
tems stay open, connected, and stable.
 Flash crashes
 Tokenization’s greater efficiency does 
not come without risk. Faster driving 
can save time, but it also makes crashes 
more likely to occur and more serious 
when they do. The same is true for finan
cial markets. Faster, automated trad
ing has already led to sudden crashes, 
known as “flash crashes,” such as the 
2010 Wall Street flash crash, when an 
estimated $1 trillion was briefly wiped 
off the value of stocks listed on the 
exchange. By making it easier to pro
gram and instantly execute automated 
trading rules, tokenized markets can be 
riskier and more volatile. 
Financial crises often unfold like 
falling dominoes, with one failure set
ting off the next, as occurred during the 
2008–09 crisis, when global giants Bear 
Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG all 
collapsed within the space of six months. 
On a token ledger, chains of programs 
can be written on top of each other, act
ing like a programmed set of falling 
dominoes during a crisis.
 Tokenization and programmability 
also make it easier to create complex 
f
 inancial products, with risks regula
tors may not understand fully until it’s 
too late. This was true of the nonpro
grammable assets that soured during 
the 2008–09 crisis and led the Financial 
Crisis Inquiry Report to conclude that a 
“complexity bubble” burst at the same 
time as the real estate bubble. “The 
securities almost no one understood, 
“Financial crises often unfold like falling dominoes, 
with one failure setting off the next.”
 build up debt, because investors or insti
tutions can use tokens as collateral to 
borrow and then invest that money else
where. If one part fails—if a token loses 
value, say—it could trigger losses across 
the system.
 Hybrid technology
 Financial assets started off as paper 
records and evolved into digital ledgers 
and programmable tokens. This trend is 
now expanding to nonfinancial assets 
such as real estate and potentially even 
agricultural collateral like farmland and 
livestock. But physical assets cannot be 
fully digitalized—they still require phys
ical care to maintain their value, as a 
farmer tends to a herd of cattle or the 
pasture where they graze. The tokeniza
tion of nonfinancial assets is best seen as 
a hybrid between physical and financial 
technology.
 From the ancient world’s cowrie 
shells to today’s digital tokens, human 
society has come to accept different 
mediums of exchange. The latest inno
vations offer clear rewards by speed
ing transactions and making trading 
cheaper. But there are risks, too. Speed, 
complexity, and risky debt have all con
tributed to previous financial crises—
 and tokenization adds to all of them. 
As with any innovation, digital tokens 
should be handled with care. F&D

 Why Europe Needs 
a Digital Euro
 Philip R. Lane
 It would safeguard monetary stability, fend off private payment 
monopolies, and stand as a potent symbol of European unity
 prudence suggests that the retail role 
should be preserved, including through 
the introduction of a digital euro.  
Central banks have a mandate to 
safeguard monetary stability in all cir
cumstances. This calls for a cautious yet 
forward-looking approach that takes into 
account not only baseline scenarios but 
also tail risks of the future development 
of the monetary system. A digital euro 
will minimize the likelihood of adverse 
economic outcomes in the future and 
ensure the resilience of the monetary 
system in an increasingly digital world.
 Cash issued by the central bank 
has historically played a critical role in 
maintaining trust in the convertibility of 
commercial bank money to central bank 
money. While convertibility is largely 
The digital euro project has a simple motivation: 
to ensure that people in a digital world retain the 
option to make or receive payments in central bank 
money. Supplementing physical cash with digital 
cash will support the modernization of the traditional 
two-tier monetary system that allows both cash and bank 
deposits as a medium of exchange. 
The evolution of the two-tier monetary system over the 
past 300 years has provided a strong foundation for the 
operation of the broader financial system and has enabled 
central banks to deliver price stability effectively. While it 
is possible to theorize about alternative monetary systems 
in which central bank money plays only a wholesale role, 
taken for granted, it’s not obvious that 
the two-tier monetary system would 
necessarily remain stable if ongoing 
digitalization meant that convertibility 
to physical cash lost relevance and a dig
ital cash option was not made available. 
Monopoly power
 Compared with other services, pay
ment instruments exhibit exception
ally strong network externalities—they 
gain value as more people use them. 
This is one reason using central bank 
money for payments improves eco
nomic efficiency: It limits the scope 
for commercial payment systems to 
exploit monopoly power by charging 
excessive fees. As the share of digital 
transactions increases, the option to 
make payments in digital euros can 
limit the potential monopoly power of 
the firms at the center of private sector 
payment networks. 
In addition, public access to central 
bank money provides a reliable fallback 
option to using commercial bank money 
for some types of transactions if there is 
disruption of the commercial banking 
system, whether from technical prob
lems or a cyberattack. This is one reason 
policymakers want a digital euro to work 
offline as well as online.

 “If banks and other payment service providers carry out the necessary know
your-customer checks, maximum privacy will be maintained, and the central 
bank will not be privy to individual account details.”
 Some argue that an alternative 
approach in adapting the monetary 
system to a digital age would be to pro
mote stablecoins, issued and operated 
by private sector intermediaries. How
ever, stablecoins are best understood as 
expanding the private money universe—
 as another substitute for bank depos
its—rather than as a true substitute for 
central bank money. A stable value of 
a stablecoin in terms of currency is not 
intrinsic (unlike a liability of the central 
bank). Even a highly liquid backing port
folio does not guarantee convertibility 
under all scenarios. 
By contrast, a well-designed digital 
euro promises to modernize the two
tier monetary system without destabi
lizing financial institutions or disrupt
ing monetary policy implementation 
or transmission. Among other fea
tures, appropriately calibrated limits 
on digital euro holdings can provide 
people sufficient digital cash for trans
actions while preventing excessive 
outflows from commercial banks and 
outsize expansion of the central bank 
balance sheet. 
Moreover, since people will set up 
digital euro accounts primarily via their 
banks (or other payment service pro
viders), close interconnection will con
tinue between central bank money and 
commercial bank money. If banks and 
other payment service providers carry 
out the necessary know-your-customer 
checks, maximum privacy will be main
tained, and the central bank will not be 
privy to individual account details. 
Unifying fragmented 
markets
 For the euro area, a digital euro offers 
additional benefits in a multicountry 
monetary union. Among other factors, 
the euro area payment system is highly 
fragmented along national lines: Cus
tomers must typically rely on non-Eu
ropean card or e-wallet providers to 
make payments across the euro area. By 
mandating acceptance of a digital euro, 
instant network effects would help unify 
the currently fragmented market. 
A digital euro would reduce costs 
for merchants and businesses by pro
viding the network infrastructure for 
an area-wide payment system on a not
for-profit basis. It would increase bar
gaining power vis-à-vis international 
card networks for both in-person trans
actions and e-commerce. A digital euro 
thereby promises to enable an area
wide fast payment system at the point 
of interaction (POI) between customers 
and merchants. With conflicting incen
tives across operators of legacy national 
payment systems, such an area-wide 
POI fast payment system will not likely 
develop without a digital euro.
 A digital euro would also provide an 
important foundation for fintech inno
vation across the continent. A standard
ized, pan-European platform would 
allow private providers to innovate 
while benefiting from the economies 
of scale of the underlying digital euro 
network, ultimately reducing costs for 
consumers and businesses alike. 
In particular, by linking customers 
and merchants across the euro area via 
a system of digital euro accounts, card 
and e-wallet providers could focus on 
additional payment services while the 
underlying payments travel via the rails 
of a digital euro system. Separation of 
the basic plumbing of the payment sys
tem (the digital euro network) from the 
delivery of add-on services also lowers 
the risk of lock-in effects—when one pri
vate payment network with a transitory 
technological advantage suppresses 
subsequent innovation in order to keep 
the upper hand.
 Symbol of unity
 To sum up, a retail role for central 
bank money is arguably integral to 
the sovereign foundations of the mon
etary system. In particular, the single
ness, effectiveness, and stability of 
the monetary system are ultimately 
underpinned by the sovereign (or, in 
the case of the euro area, the joint 
sovereignty of the European Union’s 
member states). The monetary role of 
the sovereign spans the institutional 
foundations of the monetary system 
(including the definition and enforce
ment of legal tender), the maintenance 
of the budgetary discipline required to 
ensure that monetary policy is insu
lated from fiscal dominance, and the 
delegation of various monetary tasks 
to the central bank. 
A retail role for central bank money 
maintains the direct monetary relation
ship between the sovereign and the citi
zen. It reinforces public understanding 
that monetary stability is intrinsic to sov
ereignty. This consideration is especially 
relevant in a European context, with 
the common currency seen as a critical 
mechanism for greater economic and 
political integration among member 
countries. Beyond its economic and 
monetary roles, the euro is an important 
symbol of European unity. This must be 
maintained in a digital age. F&D

 Point of View
 Behind the Veil  
of Tariff Fixation
 Michael Pettis
 The world needs a broader conception of trade policy 
that considers how economies allocate income
 In the heated debates over trade policy in Washington 
and beyond, tariffs are often portrayed as the pri
mary—or even the sole—instrument by which gov
ernments intervene in global commerce. They are 
easy to quantify, easier to politicize, and readily wielded 
in bilateral negotiations.
 But this focus on tariffs is misleading. It obscures the 
more fundamental mechanisms by which countries shape 
their trade relationships with the world. Because a country’s 
internal imbalances between consumption and produc
tion must always be consistent with its external imbalances, 
anything that affects the former must affect the latter, and 
vice versa. Tariffs are just one of many tools a government 
can use to change a country’s internal imbalance.
 Like most such tools, tariffs work by shifting income 
from consumers to producers. But because of their vis
ibility, they are often among the most politically con
tentious of these tools. By contrast, many of the most 
powerful trade interventions in today’s world occur not 
as tariffs but as policy choices that don’t appear to be 
related to trade at all. Fiscal decisions, regulatory struc
tures, labor policies, and institutional norms can all affect 
how income is distributed, and how economies are bal
anced between consumption and pro
duction, with far-reaching implications 
for global trade.
 To understand why tariffs receive 
such disproportionate attention, it helps 
to consider their visibility. A tariff is a 
line item in a trade negotiation affect
ing the price of an imported good. It’s 
easy to identify, easy to weaponize, easy 
to reverse, and very obviously linked to 
trade. But the very simplicity that makes 
a tariff politically salient also makes it a 
poor proxy for trade policy as a whole.
 Income transfer
 At its core, a tariff is a tax on imports. 
By making foreign goods more expen
sive, it gives domestic producers a pric
ing advantage. This can benefit certain 
industries and preserve jobs. But those 
benefits come at a cost: Consumers pay 
more for goods and services. The net 
effect is to transfer income from house
holds to businesses, and it is this transfer 
that, by reducing the household share of 
GDP, reduces overall consumption rela
tive to production.
 This shifting of income from con
sumers to producers is the essence of 
trade intervention. Whether through a 
tariff, a tax subsidy, or a wage-suppress
ing labor law, the result is a change in 
the internal distribution of income that 
also has external implications. If con
sumption is taxed and production is 
subsidized, net exports are likely to rise. 
Conversely, if policies shift income from 
producers to consumers, net exports are 
likely to fall. In this sense, any policy that 
affects the balance between household 
consumption and total output will also

 affect the balance between domestic  
saving and domestic investment, and so 
is effectively a trade policy.
 Consider currency policy. When a 
country intervenes in foreign exchange 
markets to keep its currency underval
“As John Maynard 
Keynes argued at 
Bretton Woods in 
F&D
 The point is that trade imbalances 
are not just about what happens at the 
border. They are a consequence of how 
economies are structured internally—
 how income is distributed, how much 
ued, it achieves the same goals as a tar
iff. A weaker currency makes imports 
more expensive and exports cheaper, 
subsidizing production and taxing con
sumption. Like tariffs, this represents a 
transfer of income from net importers 
(the household sector) to net exporters 
(the tradable goods sector), but it occurs 
through exchange rates rather than in 
the form of tariffs. 
Financial repression can have the 
same effect. In countries in which the 
banking system serves mainly the sup
ply side of the economy, suppressing 
interest rates is effectively a tax on the 
income of net savers (the household 
sector) and a credit subsidy for net bor
rowers (the producing sector). By trans
ferring income from the former to the 
latter, it creates a domestic imbalance—
 just like the one created by tariffs or an 
undervalued currency—between con
sumption and production. This shows 
up in the form of higher net exports.
 Strategic subsidies
 Tax and regulatory policies can work 
similarly. Governments might provide 
direct or indirect subsidies to strategic 
industries, including by building infra
structure tailored to manufacturing 
clusters. These measures may not vio
late international rules on trade inter
vention, but they change relative incen
tives within the economy in ways that 
mirror traditional protectionism. By 
making it cheaper or more attractive to 
produce than to consume, they achieve 
the same end: an internal shift that pro
duces an external effect.
 Even labor market structures and 
social institutions can function as tools 
of trade intervention. In China, for 
example, the hukou system—a house
hold registration system that limits 
rural migrants’ rights in urban areas—
 has long served to depress wages 
and reduce household consumption. 
Although designed mainly to manage 
urbanization, the hukou system directly

surpluses is usually

interventions.”
 affects China’s trade balance by limiting 
the growth of domestic demand relative 
to domestic supply. 
Similar effects can be seen in poli
cies that encourage environmental deg
radation (by increasing business prof
itability at the expense of health care 
costs), restrict labor from organizing, 
hold down minimum wages, or reduce 
the bargaining power of workers. By 
suppressing wage growth and limiting 
consumption relative to productivity 
growth, these policies create the same 
kinds of imbalances as tariffs, but they 
do so far more quietly.
 This broader perspective helps 
explain why some countries have run 
persistent trade surpluses even as they 
maintain relatively low tariffs. These 
economies have long emphasized pro
duction over consumption, whether 
through institutional structures, sav
ing incentives, or export-oriented indus
trial policies. The result is the same: If 
domestic demand is too weak to absorb 
national output, these countries must 
externalize the cost of weak domestic 
demand by running trade surpluses.
 households spend relative to what busi
nesses produce, and how governments 
balance the competing demands of pro
ducers and consumers.
 Implicit intervention
 When governments pursue policies that 
favor investment over consumption, 
or capital over labor, they are engag
ing implicitly in trade intervention—
 whether they intend to or not. And as 
surplus countries implement domestic 
policies that prioritize producers over 
consumers, the deficit countries with 
which they trade are effectively pri
oritizing consumers over producers, 
whether they choose to or not.
 A narrow focus on tariffs is mislead
ing. It distracts from the underlying 
drivers of trade imbalances and invites 
counterproductive responses. As John 
Maynard Keynes argued at Bretton 
Woods in 1944, the fact that a diversi
f
 ied economy runs persistent trade sur
pluses is usually sufficient evidence of 
trade-distorting interventions. Whether 
or not these distortions are created by 
tariffs is largely irrelevant; in fact, to the 
extent that tariffs in deficit economies 
can force down trade imbalances, they 
may actually promote freer trade. 
Rather than railing against tariffs, 
the world needs a broader concep
tion of trade policy—one that moves 
beyond the surface-level debate over 
tariffs and looks inward at how econ
omies allocate income. If trade imbal

 Point of View
 Multilateralism 
Can Survive the 
Loss of Consensus
 Danny Quah
 International cooperation can advance, even 
when the most powerful players are at odds
 to counter communism.
 Multilateralism is splintering today—
 not because of geopolitical competi
tion alone—but because it’s an expen
sive global public good. It benefits all 
humanity but distributes costs unevenly 
across nations.
 Even in today’s polarized world, 
geopolitical rivals can still agree on 
common goals—the planet should be 
hospitable to human beings, the next 
pandemic should be controlled and 
confined through sensible public health 
safeguards, global economic policy 
should yield prosperity for all. Nations 
might disagree on how to achieve these 
goals—arguing that one approach or 
another unfairly benefits a rival—or 
they might accuse others of free riding 
by failing to contribute toward solving a 
common problem. 
Carbon, for example, has been accu
mulating in the atmosphere for centu
ries. How should we divide the burden 
of tackling climate change between 
past and present emitters? Or how 
should we share responsibility for pro
viding financial stability and restoring 
global growth? An advanced economy 
might expend considerable resources to 
ensure growth and stability while others 
fail to behave prudently.
 Middle powers
 Can adversarial nations work together for the com
mon good? It’s natural to despair over prospects 
for international cooperation given the state of the 
world order. Geopolitical competition is straining 
the multilateral system, which has helped maintain global 
stability since the Cold War. The most powerful nations 
cannot seem to agree on how to solve urgent global prob
lems, from the climate crisis to governing economic com
petition and international trade to regulating artificial 
intelligence. 
Geopolitical competition doesn’t naturally advance 
international cooperation. The economic historian 
Charles Kindleberger showed how a lack of global lead
ership and international cooperation prolonged the Great 
Depression. Yet at other times geopolitical competition 
has, paradoxically, raised international cooperation. 
During the Cold War, for example, Presidents Dwight 
Eisenhower and John Kennedy advanced US leadership 
in open markets, free trade, and other global public goods 
If great powers refuse to support the 
international system, can others take 
their place? Global public goods are 
costly to provide. Small poor econo
mies don’t have the resources to patrol 
the seas to keep shipping lanes safe for 
international commerce or to pump 
trillions into the world economy when 
markets fail. But middle powers—those 
with sufficient economic and financial 
f
 irepower—may be candidates to take 
over the role of great powers. And mid
dle powers that are not on the front lines 
of great rivalries and are committed to 
rules-based order are in fact playing an 
increasingly consequential role. 
Without continuing US leadership, 
rules-based free trade agreements have 
already emerged. Consider the Com

 based system.
 Middle powers can afford to provide 
global public goods more easily than can 
small states. But they are just as likely 
as great powers to be swayed by dimin
ishing incentives and are just as unlikely 
to uphold multilateralism if they see no 
net benefit. Support for multilateralism 
must align with their self-interest. Their 
actions must, in other words, be incen
tive compatible.
 If the international system is to 
endure, it must have more than just 
great- or middle-power leadership. 
Incentive compatibility must replace 
the idea that size matters and will add 
more to the resilience of the interna
tional system than explicit contractual 
collaboration agreements. All nations 
must contribute in a way that delivers 
visible gains for everyone. But how is 
this possible without goodwill or con
sensus between critical actors? I pro
pose three pathways.
 Inadvertent cooperation
 First, policymakers should seek opportuni
ties for inadvertent cooperation. Cooper
ation emerges naturally when countries 
agree on a common solution to a prob
lem and can lay out explicit articles of 
collaboration. Inadvertent cooperation, 
however, means that countries cooper
ate even when they disagree: It’s about 
doing the right thing even if for the 
wrong reason. 
Inadvertent cooperation is most evi
dent when there are positive spillover 
benefits. During the COVID pandemic, 
nations raced to find a vaccine. Faster 
vaccine development was made possi
ble by a combination of mRNA technol
ogy and competition between compa
nies in different countries. The process 
meant building on what others had dis
covered, but competition yielded vac
cines that benefited everyone.
 Consider the energy transition. If 
one country considers that a competi
tor is unfairly subsidizing production of 
electric vehicles, it could subsidize its 
own production rather than slapping 
tariffs on its adversary. Such subsidies 
are a sharp riposte to its adversary but 
also increase the supply of affordable 
clean-energy vehicles, which reduces 
carbon emissions. It’s a good outcome 
for all, even though everyone is acting 
for the wrong reasons.
 Prisoners’ dilemma
 Second, policymakers in smaller nations 
should nudge the international system 
out of gridlock. When all countries seek 
their own self-interest, a prisoners’ 
dilemma can result: Every country acts 
in ways that are individually optimal 
but mutually destructive when taken 
collectively. No country can free itself 
from the dilemma: If it tries to do so 
unilaterally, others take advantage. 
When great powers get caught this 
way, a small nudge can persuade them 
to change course and pursue a collec
tively preferred outcome. 
Advanced economies, for example, 
often hesitate to grant emerging econ
omies greater access to their markets. 
Instead they put up barriers to trade, 
depriving developing economies of 
opportunities to become richer, which 
in turn drives outward migration. This 
ratchets up political tensions on all 
sides. If developing economies can 
persuade advanced economies to act 
as a group, the impact of freer trade is 
minimized; imports are spread across 
the advanced economies, and rising 
incomes in developing economies 
reduce the incentive to migrate. Nudg
ing can help great and middle powers 
do what they want to do but cannot for 
fear of losing out to adversaries.
 Pathfinder multilateralism
 Third, policymakers should strive for 
pathfinder multilateralism. When some 
nations turn their backs on multilateral
ism, subgroups of countries that favor it 
can still work together. The World Trade 
Organization’s Multi-Party Interim 
Appeal Arbitration Arrangement (MPIA) 
provides an independent appeals pro
cess to resolve trade disputes when the 
main appellate body can’t function for 
lack of a quorum. MPIA membership 
has tripled to more than 50 nations since 
2020. In pathfinder multilateralism coa
litions act together to overcome prob
lems. While the focus is different, these 
arrangements resemble what the IMF 
has called “pragmatic multilateralism.”
 The Regional Comprehensive Eco
nomic Partnership is another example. 
The 15-nation free trade agreement is 
committed to rules-based order; it’s an 
inclusive arrangement and, as well as 
members of the Association of South
east Asian Nations (ASEAN), includes 
countries as politically diverse as Austra
lia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and South 
Korea. Even as multilateralism is in retreat 
elsewhere, ASEAN countries continue to 
promote it in the Asia-Pacific region.
 International cooperation through 
multilateralism may seem impossible 
now, with consensus falling, particu
larly between geopolitical rivals. Yet 
inadvertent cooperation, overcoming 
the prisoners’ dilemma, and pathfinder 
multilateralism can restore the best of 
the international system. F&D

 Wider external gaps in key economies point to the need for policy adjustment at home
 GLOBAL CURRENT ACCOUNT  
balances—the surpluses and deficits 
arising from cross-border trade, income 
flows, and current transfers—are wid
ening again after narrowing in recent 
years. They fell to a postpandemic low 
of 3 percent of world GDP in 2023, but 
widened to 3.6 percent last year. Adjust
ing for volatility from the pandemic and 
Russia’s war in Ukraine reveals a nota
ble reversal of the narrowing since the 
global financial crisis. This may signal 
a significant structural shift.
 As the table on this page shows, sev
eral major economies have seen their 
surpluses or deficits expand, contribut
ing to the growing divergence in current 
account balances.
 Excessive deficits and surpluses can 
be sources of risks. Large, persistent 
imbalances often signal vulnerabilities. 
They typically reflect distortions—for 
example, a mismatch between a nation’s 
saving and investment—that leave econ
omies more exposed to shocks.
 The IMF’s external assessment 
shows that current account balances 
were out of line with fundamentals 
in several major economies in 2024, 
underscoring the need for adjustment. 
History demonstrates that global imbal
ances can unwind abruptly and pain
fully. To avoid such a scenario, a gradual 
correction is needed through concerted 
domestic macroeconomic policies. 
Deficit countries should curb excess 
spending and improve competitiveness 
to narrow their external gaps, while sur
plus countries should boost domestic 
demand and investment to better absorb 
their output. Such steps would gradually 
shrink imbalances and foster more bal
anced, resilient global growth. F&D

 New technologies are rewiring liquidity,

 Frontiers of Finance
 ore than 15 years after the global finan
cial crisis, the banking and financial 
system looks safer. But it’s also evolv
ing in ways that are reshaping who 
provides liquidity, how money moves, 
and risks to economic and financial stability. As a 
result, the next shock may begin not in a bank, but 
in the new infrastructure underpinning the system.
 After 2008, regulators moved swiftly to raise 
capital standards and introduce new supervisory 
tools such as stress testing. Banks rebuilt their bal
ance sheets and retreated from risky lending and 
arbitrage businesses. Asset managers were blamed 
for the financial turmoil at the onset of the pan
demic, but not banks.
 Yet even as regulators fortified banks, postcri
sis innovations reshaped the financial landscape. 
Asset managers provided more liquidity as banks 
stepped back, nonbank start-ups built new risk 
assessment tools for institutional lenders, devel
opers introduced a wider array of crypto assets, and 
central banks and governments established real
time payment systems.
 These developments cut costs, broadened 
access, and accelerated transactions. Yet they also 
caused significant shifts in the structure of financial 
intermediation. Liquidity, credit, and payments—
 the core of the banking system—gravitated toward 
asset managers, tech platforms, and decentralized 
networks.
 This reshaping of finance itself now raises big 
questions. What happens when critical finance 
functions lie outside the regulatory framework? 
How should we ensure stability in a faster, flatter, 
and more fragmented financial system?
 From banks to asset managers 
Banks were once the protagonists of liquidity cre
ation for financial markets. Yet today, it is non
bank asset management funds, not banks, that 
contribute a growing share of the system’s day
to-day liquidity to households and investors 
(Chart 1). Open-end mutual funds and exchange
traded funds (ETFs) let investors redeem money 
on demand, even though these funds hold assets 
such as corporate bonds that are anything but liq
uid. They promise daily liquidity but hold underly
ing assets that can’t always be sold—just as banks 
do, but without deposit insurance, capital buffers, 
or access to the central bank.
 This isn’t theory. It’s happening. My research 
with Columbia University’s Yiming Ma and Kai
rong Xiao shows that bond mutual funds alone 
now supply sizable liquidity compared with the 
entire banking system, and this share is rising. Yet 
when markets turn volatile, mutual funds can be 
shock amplifiers rather than absorbers. They may 
be forced to sell illiquid assets in a falling market, 
deepening the stress.
 ETFs add complexity. On paper, most ETFs 
are passive vehicles. More than 95 percent track 
an index, such as the S&P 500 or Bloomberg US 
Aggregate Bond Index. But in practice, many are 
surprisingly active. There are now more ETFs than 
underlying assets. For many asset classes, inves
tors can choose among plain-vanilla trackers, sec
tor-specific funds, smart beta strategies, and even 
thematic products like AI-, robotics-, and green-fo
cused ETFs. 
Behind the scenes, ETF sponsors must actively 
manage portfolios to meet investor flows and 
keep prices in line with the value of the underly
ing assets. Bond ETF managers frequently deviate 
from their stated benchmarks, as my work with 
Naz Koont of Stanford University, Lubos Pastor 
of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of 
Business, and Columbia’s Ma shows. Bond ETFs, 
especially, trade like liquid stocks but hold under
lying illiquid bonds. They rely on a network of spe
cialized intermediaries, called authorized partic
ipants, to arbitrage price discrepancies between 
ETFs and underlying assets. 
These participants are also bond dealers and 
use the same balance sheets both in their role of 
managing ETFs and to serve their trading clients. 
When dealer balance sheets get tight, or when bond 
markets seize up, ETF arbitrage can break down. 
Prices drift, and liquidity thins. And investors who 
expected stock-like flexibility may be left holding 
something closer to a closed-end fund.
 The new ecosystem of liquidity provision is 
more market based, broader, and potentially 
cheaper than the old one. After all, bankers face 
greater constraints in providing daily liquidity, and 
asset managers step in to fill the gap. But the new 
ecosystem plays by a different rule book, with dif
ferent risks when markets freeze.
 AI and big data
 Lending, once the province of bankers and loan offi
cers, increasingly relies on AI and big data. Non
bank fintech platforms use payment records and

borrowers that traditional banks often overlook. 
Data, in turn, flows more freely between borrow
ers and lenders, training increasingly precise and 
adaptive machines. My research with the Indian 
Institute of Management’s Pulak Ghosh and Har
vard’s Boris Vallee shows how this plays out in India. 
Small merchants who rely more on cashless pay
ments with detailed and traceable paper trails get 
better access to working-capital loans. They pay 
lower interest rates and are less likely to default. In 
effect, digital footprints are the new credit scores. 
This credit-data feedback loop has boosted the 
power of Big Tech. Platforms such as Alibaba’s Ant 
Group, Amazon, and Latin America’s Mercado 
Libre now bundle payments, e-commerce, and

 Scale delivers convenience, but also concentra
tion: The platform that controls the checkout but
ton can steer borrowers and merchants away from 
rival bank lenders, raising difficult questions about 
competition.
 Size is not the only concern. Because Big Tech 
sits outside traditional safety nets, traditional cap
ital, liquidity, and resolution rules do not yet apply. 
In 2024, Amazon abruptly discontinued its $140 
billion in-house lending program to small busi
nesses, illustrating how platform credit can vanish 
just when firms need it most. As AI- and data-driven 
lending pushes ever more credit through a few dig
ital gateways, more questions crop up alongside the 
emergence of too-big-to-fail tech monopolies.
 Crypto and instant payments
 Also at the core of this changing banking landscape 
is the evolution of payment intermediation. Bitcoin 
was released in 2008 during the financial crisis as 
an alternative form of money for payments. Built 
on blockchain technology, Bitcoin aimed to bypass 
commercial banks and central banks, offering a 
decentralized way to move money without relying 
on trust in institutions. For good or ill, Bitcoin never 
fulfilled that promise. It’s slow to settle, costly to

 use, and highly volatile. For most crypto believers, 
it is less digital dollar and more digital gold: a specu
lative asset, not functional money.
 Stablecoins, a close cousin of Bitcoin, emerged 
to fix this (Chart 2). Like Bitcoin, stablecoins are 
blockchain assets designed to provide payment ser
vices. New US legislation, including the GENIUS 
and STABLE acts, may further boost their growth. 
An important difference from Bitcoin is that stable
coins are pegged to real-world currencies, usually 
the US dollar. Issuers like Circle (USDC) and Tether 
(USDT) hold reserves in bank deposits, Treasury 
securities, and corporate bonds to maintain that 
peg. Avoiding the huge volatility of Bitcoin, stable
coins have shown promise as a cheap and border
less payment alternative. Stablecoins have become 
lifelines in Argentina, Türkiye, and Venezuela,

 where inflation is high; ordinary people in these 
economies now use stablecoins for saving, send
ing remittances, and settling transactions. They are 
steadily moving into mainstream payment flows as 
big banks and giant merchants contemplate issuing 
their own stablecoins.
 But just like mutual funds and ETFs, stablecoins 
lack traditional safeguards such as deposit insur
ance and direct access to central bank support. In 
March 2023, when Silicon Valley Bank failed, Cir
cle’s USDC temporarily lost its peg after losing 
access to reserves. The previous year, the collapse 
of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin triggered wide
spread losses. My research with Columbia’s Ma and 
Chicago Booth’s Anthony Lee Zhang highlights a 
core dilemma facing stablecoins: The more effec
tively they maintain stable prices, the more they 
resemble banks—yet without deposit insurance or a 
lender of last resort, making them more vulnerable 
to runs. These observations make one thing clear: 
Stablecoins may function well in good times, but 
they can falter under stress. 
Alongside the rise of private crypto payment 
alternatives, government-sponsored fast payment 
systems offer a different path. After all, people 
value speed and efficiency in payments, yet crypto 
assets are neither as fast nor as cheap as they claim. 
Brazil’s central bank introduced Pix, a fast, free pay

ment system built on traditional bank payment rails 
and always available. It processes more daily trans
actions than cash, credit, and debit cards combined. 
More than 90 percent of Brazilian households and 
businesses have adopted it. India’s Unified Pay
ments Interface followed a similar trajectory (see 
“India’s Frictionless Payments” in this issue of F&D). 
These systems deliver what crypto promised—
 faster, more inclusive payments—but in a far less 
disruptive way. They have attracted growing inter
national attention, including praise from the Bank

 for International Settlements, for promoting finan
cial inclusion while preserving monetary stability.
 Despite the merits, however, fast payment sys
tems come with trade-offs. My new research with 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Ding 
Ding, the Central Bank of Brazil’s Rodrigo Gonza
lez, and Columbia’s Ma shows that payment sys
tems like Pix force banks to hold more liquid assets 
to meet unpredictable outflows, reduce bank lend
ing, and—perhaps surprisingly—increase credit risk. 
This is because the convenience of fast payments to 
consumers comes at the expense of banks’ losses in 
delaying and netting payment flows. Fast payments 
increase banks’ need to hold liquid assets such as 
cash and government bonds over extending illiquid 
loans. When banks hold more liquid low-yielding 
assets, in turn, it exacerbates their yield-seeking 
incentives in extending riskier loans. In a sense, the 
payment system becomes faster, yet fast payments 
may inadvertently make the banking model nar
rower and potentially riskier.
 Macro-financial implications
 Banks are safer thanks to stronger capital require
ments, tighter supervision, and regular stress tests. 
But we have not necessarily protected the macro
economic environment.

 First, the financial system is more fragmented. 
Key functions, payments, credit, and liquidity have 
shifted outside the regulatory perimeter. Mutual 
funds, ETFs, and stablecoins mimic deposits. 
Robots and platforms extend credit. But unlike 
banks, they operate without deposit insurance, 
lender-of-last-resort access, or systemic over
sight. This, combined with geoeconomic rivalries, 
increases the possibility of a more fragmented 
f
 inancial system, posing challenges to global regu
latory coordination, as highlighted by the European 
Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde and the People’s 
Bank of China’s Pan Gongsheng. The risks didn’t 
vanish. They just moved.
 Second, capital flows have accelerated. Real
time trading, credit-data loops, and fast payments 
may all amplify shocks. What once took days now 
happens in minutes. Yet the tools for absorbing 
stress, liquidity backstops, and market interven
tions haven’t caught up. The plumbing is faster, but 
the stabilizers aren’t.
 Third, the policy toolkit may have gradually 
become misaligned. Central banks built their 
frameworks for a bank-dominated system in which 
deposit rates influence lending and lender-of-last
resort facilities calm depositors. But when money 
resides with asset managers or as on-chain trans
actions or moves through apps, traditional barom
eters are less effective. It’s harder to see where risk 
builds, and harder to stop it when it breaks.
 The global financial landscape has changed, yet 
the rules remain largely unchanged—and that mis
match may be the biggest risk of all. F&D

threaten government revenues and take us back 
to a 19th century world of private money issuers 
competing for seigniorage, which would fragment 
and destabilize the international financial system. 
Implications of stablecoins
 Stablecoins issued by the private sector bridge the 
conventional financial system and the crypto eco
system. They promise stable value relative to fiat 
currencies, mainly by holding liquid assets such as 
US Treasuries, and operate on blockchains. They 
share some features with money market funds and 
with “narrow banking”—also known as 100 per
cent reserve banking—though they typically do 
not, so far, offer an interest payment. Almost all 
BRIAN STAUFFER
 stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, but most 
transactions happen outside the United States. Sta
blecoins tend to be used as on- and off-ramps to 
crypto assets, in which case they are probably vehi
cles for speculative investments. But increasingly, 
they are also a cross-border payment instrument. 
They are useful where the domestic financial sys
tem is weak or costly to use or when international 
f
 inancial transactions are regulated, either because 
of capital controls or externally imposed sanctions. 
In a world where stablecoins, particularly those 
pegged to the dollar, become an important global 
payment tool, we must brace ourselves for substan
tial consequences. On the negative side are dollar
ization and its side effects, financial stability risks, 
potential hollowing out of the banking system, cur
rency competition and instability, money launder
ing, fiscal base erosion, privatization of seigniorage, 
and intense lobbying. On the positive side, cross-bor
der payments may be quicker and cheaper, which 
matters especially for remittances. And citizens of 
countries with poor governance would have access 
to more stable and convenient means of payment 
and store of value than their domestic currency. 
Who gets payment data and US dominance when it 
comes to imposing sanctions will be affected as well. 
Clearly these possibilities warrant more discussion.

 Capital flows and intermediation
 US dollar stablecoins inherit some characteristics of 
their parent, the most important international cur
rency. Tied to the dominant unit of account, they 
can benefit from the dollar ecosystem’s network 
externalities and from its credibility and hence 
have the potential to be an important medium of 
exchange worldwide, facilitating transactions and 
remittances. By superseding the system of corre
spondent banking and messaging systems such as 
SWIFT, they may speed up and lower the costs of 
cross-border transactions, improving efficiency. 
But some of this decrease in cost may result from a 
lack of know-your-customer and anti–money laun
dering compliance—that is, if regulatory authorities 
do not catch up. Stablecoins are certainly also an 
attractive way to get around sanctions and engage 
in illegal transactions. They are more stable than 
Bitcoin and Ether, which have been used precisely 
for those purposes (Graf von Luckner, Reinhart, 
and Rogoff 2023; Graf von Luckner, Koepke, and 
Sgherri 2024). Unbacked crypto assets and stable
coins could thus help channel money linked to illicit 
or sanctioned activities and substantially erode the 
tax base of many countries. Crypto users are likely 
to find off-ramps to conventional financial systems 
in some jurisdictions, offshore or even onshore.
 If the use of US dollar stablecoins increases mas
sively worldwide, it could hollow out banking sec
tors because of competition for deposits. If banks 
themselves issue stablecoins, it could curb lending 
and increase US Treasury holdings—assuming these 
are the main assets backing the stablecoins—on the 
asset side of the balance sheet, a development akin 
to narrow banking. The effects on systemic risk, as 
well as the potential questionability of some actors’ 
backing of stablecoins and the ensuing run risks, 
bear a close look. And the classic cost of dollariza
tion around the world should be kept in mind: It can 
alter the transmission channels of monetary policy 
and hinder macroeconomic stabilization. 
Privatization of seigniorage 
For the rest of the world, including Europe, wide 
adoption of US dollar stablecoins for payment 
purposes would be equivalent to the privatization 
of seigniorage by global actors. Along with easier 
f
 lows linked to tax evasion, fiscal accounts could be 
affected. On the asset side, the backing of stable
coins means that increased international adoption 
of those pegged to the dollar could lower demand 
for non–US government bonds and raise demand 
for US Treasuries. The magnitude of this effect 
will depend on substitution patterns between dol
lar-backed crypto assets and money market funds 
and deposits in local currencies and dollars. Tether

 and USDC already hold collectively more US Trea
suries than Saudi Arabia, as shown in Chapter 2 of 
the IMF’s July 2025 External Sector Report. Thus, by 
increasing the demand for Treasuries and the stock 
of US external safe liabilities, US dollar stablecoins 
could reinforce the “world banker” balance sheet 
of the United States and help stabilize US finances 
and external deficits. These stablecoins could con
stitute a digital pillar strengthening the exorbitant 
privilege of the US dollar. 
Another consequence of growing US dollar sta
blecoin flows, leading to the privatization of global 
seigniorage, is significant wealth accumulation 
by what is likely, given the strength of network 
externalities, to be a few companies and individ
uals. From a political economy perspective, this 
will usher in increased lobbying for deregulation 
and opacity of international capital flows. Such an 
outcome would defy the public good dimension of 
the international monetary system. Unfortunately, 
data collection efforts on crypto capital flows by 
international organizations and country authori
ties are still in their infancy. There are two valuable 
contributions in recent IMF research that describe 
these challenges (Reuter 2025; Cardozo and oth
ers 2024). Since the emergence of cryptocurrencies 
may threaten core macroeconomic policies and the 
f
 inancing and provision of national and global pub
lic goods, measuring their flows, use, and global 
regulation should be a policy priority. 
Tokenization and integration
 Tokenization could integrate messaging, recon
ciliation, and asset transfer on a unified ledger 
where central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) 
also play a major role. Different countries’ CBDCs 
could be linked for efficient cross-border transac
tions, according to the Bank for International Set
tlements. Global capital flows could be reshaped

 tosystems currently in use. This problem is often 
ignored. The development of post-quantum cryp
tography, secure against both quantum and classic 
computers and interoperable with existing com
munications protocols and networks, is progress
ing, but the outcome is uncertain given the race 
for computer power. Hence the currency networks 
most exposed to hacking and to losing their integ
rity will see massive confidence crises and capi
tal outflows, which could spur financial crises. In 
such a world, the currency network with the small
est attack surface for hackers should harvest a pre
mium and reduce its financing costs—this could 
be called an “integrity privilege.” 
To conclude, the impact of technology on the 
international monetary and financial system will 
be profound but is hard to forecast: It will be shaped 
by unpredictable innovations, regulatory policies, 
and lobbying groups. Major financial stability risks, 
including increased volatility in exchange rates; 
threats to public finances in many economies; and 
competition across currency networks are likely. It 
may result in large wealth transfers, which will alter 
the political economy of regulation. International 
policy cooperation is therefore essential. Finally, 
new technologies  may reshuffle international cur
rency dominance and result in the emergence of an 
integrity privilege. F&D

Access to foreign assets has historically been 
restricted by barriers such as capital controls, reg
ulation, and inefficient cross-border payments. 
Interoperability and new trading platforms for 
global assets such as stocks, bonds, and commod
ities could open up access for individual investors, 
wherever they are. Decentralized finance (DeFi) 
platforms could amplify these benefits with peer
to-peer transactions, cutting out intermediaries 
such as banks and brokers. Tokenization may thus 
expand financial integration, bringing both advan
tages and well-known challenges. 
Currencies and financial stability 
Such a system could mean more substitutability 
across currencies and therefore more competi
tion, leading to large portfolio shifts across cur
rency networks. Increasing returns to scale will play 
out in this larger international arena, as will forces 
pushing for a single unit of account; the incumbent 
dollar has a head start. But the strategic value of 
payment data and the desire for sovereignty in dif
ferent jurisdictions’ payment systems could fuel 
fragmentation and even restrictions on the use of 
some currencies. The emergence of programmable 
capital controls and granular restrictions on wal
lets is possible, and a more multipolar international 
monetary system could follow. The coexistence of 
multiple connected networks could even fracture 
the monetary and financial system if several pri
vate issuers gain market share and tokenization 
platforms proliferate. But such a world is inher
ently fragile. History tells us that private monies 
are unstable for all the traditional reasons linked 
to lack of credibility. When they are not well reg
ulated and not backed by a sovereign that can tax 
and enforce contracts, private monies often lead 
to runs. Sovereign currencies themselves may be 
unstable when the credibility of their institutions—
 in particular, their fiscal institutions—is questioned. 
International policy cooperation and regulation are 
essential to prevent excessive fragmentation and 
financial fragility.

loss of credibility also comes from loss of data integ
rity. The US Commerce Department’s National

 TECH MEETS FINANCE

 Fintech companies will compete against, and 
cooperate with, traditional banks; public policy 
must provide direction
 D
 igital innovation often starts with a radi
cal idea. It can be a new way to store and 
process information, a new business 
model, or a new service. But the idea is 
just the start: Realizing the benefits of 
innovation requires hard work, sufficient invest
ment, and user adoption. 
Disruptive innovation has been the name of 
the game in the financial sector over the past 
decade. New financial technology (fintech) firms 
have emerged, large digital platforms (big techs) 
are offering payment services and credit, crypto 
assets and stablecoins are growing in value, and 
many institutions are adopting artificial intelli
gence. Each of these is challenging traditional 
f
 inancial intermediaries, like banks, insurers, and 
asset managers, and the services that they provide 
(Ben Naceur and others 2023). 
Digital innovations can both complement and 
substitute for services in the traditional financial 
system. Many services seem to offer a stark alter
native to existing intermediaries and services in the 
28
 short term. But in the medium term, they often com
plement existing services, leading to even greater 
competition and a more diverse financial system. 
Still, innovations don’t always lead to the best out
comes on their own: Things can, and frequently do, 
go wrong. Harnessing the benefits of digital innova
tion often requires forward-thinking public policy. 
Disruption in payments 
Payments are the gateway to financial services. For 
individuals, a transaction account is often a prereq
uisite for accessing credit, buying an insurance pol
icy, or starting to save and invest. For new entrants 
to the financial system, like fintechs and big techs, it 
is common to start by handling payments and then 
branch out into other areas of finance. 
In the past decade, the way we pay has changed 
dramatically, with so-called fast or instant payment 
systems taking off in many countries, especially 
emerging markets (see Chart 1). They allow for real
time (or nearly real-time) transfers between end 
users (Frost and others 2024). Fast, 24/7 payments

 are provided by fintechs, big techs, and existing banks. 
They use smartphone apps and quick response (QR) 
codes, even operating on lower-tech phones. They 
have generally allowed disruptors to provide services 
that directly compete with incumbents. 
The most well-known success stories come from 
public infrastructures, such as systems operated, or 
overseen, by central banks. In Brazil, for instance, 
the central bank introduced its fast payment sys
tem Pix in November 2020. Now, over 90 percent of 
Brazilian adults use the service for daily retail pay
ments, such as food or travel, and even for recurring 
payments like utility bills. In India, the Unified Pay
ments Interface (UPI)—operated by the National 
Payments Corporation of India and regulated by 
the central bank—promotes services by incumbent 
banks, fintechs, and big techs on one platform (see 
“India’s Frictionless Payments” in this issue of F&D). 
Similar successes include Thailand’s PromptPay, 
which is privately run but with a key role for the cen
tral bank, and SINPE Móvil in Costa Rica, operated 
by the central bank.
 These successful public infrastructures stand in 
contrast to the situation in many economies where 
there are multiple private sector fast payment sys
tems inaccessible to users of other financial institu
tions. For example, in the US, someone using only 
Venmo cannot pay someone who uses only Zelle. 
Similar “walled gardens” have also arisen in China, 
with competing wallets by Alipay and WeChat Pay, 
and in Peru, where the wallets Yape and Plin com
pete for users (Aurazo and Gasmi 2024). In the case 
of China and Peru, policy intervention was needed 
to make payment systems interoperable. 
Often, what begins as a substitute (fintech and 
big tech challengers) can complement existing 
services operating in the same market. Users get 
cheaper, faster payments, which can also support 
f
 inancial resilience and higher economic growth. 
The disruptors—and public policy—help improve 
the system, serve new clients, offer new services in 
the same market, and push incumbents to enhance 
their offerings. 
A digital credit metamorphosis
 Beyond payments comes the need to borrow. Com
panies need credit to make productive investments, 
and people need it to buy a house or a car or to pay 
for education. 
In the early days of the fintech revolution, it 
looked like new lending platforms could end up 
replacing many functions of banks. Crowdlend
ing and other new credit platforms grew quickly, 
often using alternative data for credit scoring and 
connecting borrowers and lenders in streamlined, 
digital processes. This was soon overshadowed by 
new lending by big tech providers, such as mer
chant lending by Amazon in the US and Alibaba 
in China. The volume of big tech credit boomed 
(Cornelli and others 2023). 
These new platforms have narrowed gaps in 
credit markets and enhanced financial inclusion. In 
Argentina, for example, Mercado Pago has stepped 
in to support small merchants spurned by banks. 
In China, big tech credit has been less sensitive to 
home prices than bank credit, potentially reduc
ing the importance of collateral. In the US, fintech 
small business lenders have targeted areas with high 
unemployment and bankruptcies, where banks are 
less likely to lend. Overall, the impact of fintech and 
big tech varies widely from country to country. 
But banks are very much still in the picture, com
peting now with a new set of intermediaries. They 
changed their business models to look more like 
platforms, and to use alternative data. Conversely, 
many challengers, such as the UK’s Revolut and 
Brazil’s Nubank, obtained licenses and became 
banks themselves. 
Crypto and DeFi
 While big techs challenge incumbent financial 
institutions at their own game, crypto assets and 
decentralized finance (DeFi) promise to reimagine 
f
 inance, based on trust in code rather than in insti

 progress in access to payment accounts, has been 
possible thanks to an interplay of public sector 
infrastructures and private innovation. Proactive 
steps by public authorities, even in the face of ini
tial reluctance by incumbents, helped improve pay
ment services and financial inclusion, as most nota
bly shown with UPI in India and Pix in Brazil. This 
helped bring hundreds of millions of people into 
the financial system worldwide. 
Meanwhile, important risks are emerging from 
innovation that could erode financial stability. For 
instance, shocks from the crypto sector could spill 
over to the traditional financial system, poten
tially even posing risks to the US Treasury market 
(Ahmed and Aldasoro 2025). 
To harness the potential of innovation and mit
igate the risks, radical new ideas are necessary, but 
not sufficient. Also needed are public infrastruc
tures, sound regulation, and practical experimen
tation in the public and private sectors to yield new 
insights and inform private investment and pub
lic policy. Finally, the public and private sectors 
need to coordinate to guide digital technologies 
toward applications that truly benefit people and 
businesses and lay a solid foundation for prosper
ity. A recent example of this type of coordination is 
Project Agorá, which brings together central banks 
and commercial banks to explore a unified ledger to 
leverage the benefits of tokenization for cross-bor
der payments. F&D

tutions. Global crypto adoption is on the rise again, 
despite its long history of volatility, mostly for 
speculative investment purposes, but also thanks to 
political support for these assets in some countries.
 Crypto was intended to foster decentralization, 
but it hasn’t really turned out that way. Crypto 
exchanges, traditional banks, investment funds, 
and others entering the market mean that the 
market remains intermediated and often cen
tralized. More important, unbacked crypto assets 
often have limited usability because they can be 
extremely volatile. 
Stablecoins, which tie their value to the fiat cur
rencies that crypto ostensibly challenged, emerged 
as an alternative. The largest stablecoins are issued 
by centralized entities that hold assets such as US 
Treasury bills and bank deposits to back stablecoins 
in circulation. But even with these new intermedi
aries, and with the growing presence of stablecoins, 
the crypto sector remains riddled with risks, includ
ing widespread fraud, scams, money laundering, 
and terrorism financing. In addition, stablecoins 
fall short of providing necessary elasticity in the 
monetary system. Because more than 98 percent of 
stablecoins by value are tied to the US dollar, they 
can also undermine monetary sovereignty in many 
jurisdictions.
 Still, crypto and stablecoins provide a glimpse of 
functionality that may have broader applicability. For 
example, programmability and tokenization could 
improve existing functions and enable new ones 
within the existing monetary system, based on central 
banks at the core and commercial banks interacting 
with clients. In cross-border payments, for example, 
tokenization could rewire the correspondent banking 
system, allowing for messaging, reconciliation, and 
asset transfer in a single action. New functions like 
simultaneous (“atomic”) settlement and enhanced 
collateral management could dramatically improve 
the functioning of capital markets. These functions 
could lay the foundation for a future tokenized finan
cial system.
 Public policy to guide innovation 
These radical innovations have significantly 
changed the financial system over the past decade. 
Stark challenges that threatened to substitute for 
existing services have often evolved into something 
new that is complementary to those services—fre
quently fostering competition. And by and large, 
this has helped lower consumer prices and made 
services more efficient. But innovation may not 
always lead to the best outcomes on its own. 
Forward-looking public policies allowed for 
some of the biggest, most impactful breakthroughs.

 Fighting financial crime doesn’t have to come at the cost of privacy
 L
 egend has it that gangster Al Capone hid 
the illicit origins of his wealth by using 
laundromats as a front. Ever since, author
ities have worked to track and seize “laun
dered” money from criminals and, more 
recently, terrorists. 
These efforts are even trickier today because 
of digital assets such as stablecoins, which can be 
washed through many accounts beyond the reach 
of law enforcement. But the need to stop bad actors 
must not trammel the privacy rights of law-abiding 
people nor the efficient processing of billions of dol
lars in payments and transfers every day.
 These goals may seem unreachable, but we 
argue that technology may actually make this 
objective feasible. 
“Smart-compliant” payment systems that fight 
32
 crime, protect privacy, and work efficiently are 
within reach. These systems can be built directly 
into the blockchains of stablecoins—digital assets 
pegged to traditional money. 
How would this work in practice? Say Alice 
wants to pay Bob. Once she taps “send” in her 
phone app, previous verification of their identi
ties is confirmed, the transaction is reviewed by 
a decentralized algorithm for suspicious activity, 
and the operation is completed—all on a block
chain. Flagged transactions would automatically 
be reported to law enforcement. The identities of 
Alice and Bob, however, could be unmasked only 
with a warrant or through another legal process.
 With anticipated advances in technology, this 
compliance-by-design vision could become a prac
tical reality for large-scale payment systems.

 Balancing privacy and transparency
 New attempts at regulating blockchain-based 
f
 inance do not resolve the fundamental tension 
between the protection of privacy and legal com
pliance. In payment systems, compliance and pri
vacy are traditionally competing forces. Stablecoin 
payment systems exemplify this tension. But they 
may also offer a natural compromise since their 
decentralized and programmable architecture 
allows compliance mechanisms to be built in, and 
their pseudonymity helps keep privacy risks low. 
This article explains how a “compliance-by-de
sign” approach (Duffie, Olowookere, and Veneris 
2025) could make it possible for decentralized 
stablecoin payment systems to protect privacy 
and enforce anti–money laundering (AML) and 
countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) reg
ulations and sanctions. Compliance enforcement 
would take place as transactions occur, based on 
predefined criteria and risk indicators, instead of 
reactively, as is the case today. This approach is in 
line with the 2023 IMF–Financial Stability Board 
policy framework for crypto assets, which calls for 
compliance measures for stablecoin providers.  
In such an environment, stablecoin users are 
likely to split into two groups. If institutions and 
individuals value both compliance and confiden
tiality, they are likely to select a compliance-by-de
sign payment network. Others may continue using 
legacy approaches to stablecoin payments that are 
based on pseudonymity and relatively loose com
pliance constraints.
 Before going deeper, let’s define privacy inter
ests in the context of stablecoin payments. For 
individuals, a major concern is the protection of 
personal information, including names, home 
addresses, and phone numbers. For corporations 
and institutions, privacy concerns may include 
transaction metadata—such as amounts, time 
stamps, patterns, and counterparties—which may 
be commercially sensitive. For businesses, main
taining confidentiality is not only strategically 
important, it is often also a legal requirement.
 Compliance involves know-your-customer 
(KYC) standards and monitoring of payments for 
illegal activity. Currently, stablecoin providers del
egate compliance tasks to centralized exchanges 
and other custodians that provide on-ramps and 
off-ramps for conversion between stablecoins and 
traditional currencies. 
However, the ability to mint stablecoins and 
move them between multiple accounts with decen
tralized protocols, and the availability of “mixers” 
that obscure the trail of any single coin, makes it rel
atively easy to obscure transactions. Law enforce
ment has limited reach and is often reactive, trig
gered only after suspicious activity is detected. As 
a result, compliance with AML, CFT, and sanctions 
frameworks is relatively ineffective. Moreover, 
compliant users’ privacy is limited because pay
ments are publicly observable and transparently 
linked to the user’s pseudonym.
 Reconciling privacy standards with regulatory 
compliance calls for a model that better protects 
user data while reasonably enforcing the law. 
This requires a way to verify identities without 
exposing them. 
Verification without exposure
 In a compliance-by-design decentralized payment 
system, before Alice can pay Bob, both must have 
undergone identity verification by a licensed pro
vider of such services (subsequently referred to as a 
credential issuer), as illustrated in Chart 1. Verifica
tion places Alice and Bob within the KYC perimeter 
of their chosen decentralized payment system. This 
verification is stored on the payment-system ledger 
as a “hashed” (cryptographically masked) certificate.
 At this point, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) 
come into play. These are cryptographic tools that 
can be implemented in a multiuser software plat
form, allowing a user to prove something without 
revealing what that something is. For example, a 
ZKP can establish which poker hand wins without 
revealing the cards of that player. 
Likewise, ZKPs can allow users of a decentral
ized payment system to demonstrate know-your
customer compliance without revealing their 
personal data. It works by ensuring that each trans
action that users initiate includes a ZKP proof of 
their eligibility to be inside the KYC perimeter of 
the payment system—without revealing their iden
tity or any other underlying personal information. 
This approach could be used in any decentral
ized payment system, in particular a system based 
on stablecoins. In principle, the same approach 
could be applied to decentralized payment sys
tems based on central bank digital currencies and 
other digital representations of money.
 Privacy is preserved unless specific risk indica
tors, such as unusual transaction patterns, trans
fers exceeding designated thresholds, or links to

 known offenders may be blocked. These responses 
are enforced through smart contracts that can be 
dynamically updated to reflect evolving regulatory 
priorities, special cases, and insights obtained from 
the statistical analysis of payment patterns.
 The KYC credential maintained by issuers 
secures databases of validated user credentials 
and allows them to be updated or revoked when 
compromised. If Alice’s legal status changes—for 
example, as a result of  a sanction—her compliance 
proof would fail and her transactions within the 
KYC perimeter would be blocked.
 The stablecoin payment system we have 
described replaces time-consuming “off-chain” 
manual reactive reviews—common practice 
today—with proactive real-time “on-chain” algo
rithmic supervision. By leveraging smart contracts 
to apply compliance rules as transactions occur, 
this framework taps directly into the strengths of 
blockchain systems.
 Implementation
 The KYC perimeter could be implemented using 
zero-knowledge KYCs (zkKYCs) (Pauwels 2021), 
which combine zero-knowledge proofs with selec
tive disclosure. For example, Alice can prove that 
she meets specific identity checks (like being over 
18) without revealing her age. Under this approach, 
a government agency or authorized financial insti
tution issues Alice a verifiable credential derived 
from her official or government-issued identity 
documentation. A cryptographically protected 
version of this credential is stored in each user’s 
private digital wallet.
 During a transaction, a zkKYC token generated 
from this credential is embedded on-chain. This 
token proves KYC compliance without revealing 
user identities, and the underlying credentials 
remain securely off-chain with the credential issuer. 
For payments by natural persons, such as peer-to
peer or customer-to-business payments, identity 
spoofing can be mitigated by anchoring verifiable 
credentials to standardized legal documents such 
as passports or driver’s licenses.
 For example, when Alice initiates a payment to 
Bob, her wallet generates a zkKYC token that cryp
tographically proves that Alice has a verifiable cre
dential. The token confirms that Alice has under

 gone KYC certification and belongs within the KYC 
perimeter. The token also indicates whether Alice 
is an individual or an institution and confirms the 
transaction amount, wallet thresholds, and other 
relevant data. This token need not reveal Alice’s 
identity or transaction details to Bob or any third 
party unless Alice agrees, or unless a SAR is trig
gered and a legal basis for disclosure is established.
 Automated compliance enforcement relies on 
ledger-embedded smart contracts that analyze 
encrypted information contained in zkKYC tokens 
for a match with specified SAR criteria. If a match is 
found, the contract automatically generates a SAR, 
allowing enforcement without significantly com
promising the privacy of compliant users.
 Technological and systemic 
challenges
 Compliance by design offers a promising path for
ward but is not a silver bullet. The approach we 
have outlined involves a significant computational 
burden for a large-scale modern payment system. 
Smart contracts must be capable of interpreting 
complex and evolving regulations at a throughput 
rate that allows close-to-real-time payments. Going 
instead for a very simplistic approach could gener

ance checks, overwhelming enforcement authori
ties with noise and risking exploitation by bad actors.
 Another challenge is the computational cost of pri
vacy-preserving mechanisms, risking delays during 
peak-payment periods. Compliance-by-design pay
ment systems may also add frictional costs and delays 
to moving funds between different payment systems. 
One solution to the computational burden 
problem would be to allow regulated providers to 
license and manage smart contracts, providing 
compliance as a service. With this setup, users 
could grant limited access to their payment data in 
exchange for compliance services and other bene
f
 its, mirroring how privacy and consumer risk are 
managed by private firms today.
 Further, as applied cryptography remains a 
fast-evolving field, new zero-knowledge-proof 
implementation promises to be faster. And new 
techniques, like multiparty computation, may help 
with the computational burden of administering 
smart contracts. 
The road ahead
 The compliance-by-design model presented here 
relies on sound governance. Establishing a trusted 
ecosystem of credential issuers is critical. Creden
tial issuers and smart contract operators must be 
carefully licensed and must operate transparently 
and with accountability. Governments, banks, and 
certified financial technology firms could be the 
trusted nodes that anchor users to the compliance 
perimeter. Trusted credential issuers must follow 
uniform standards for KYC verification, and their 
verification should be interoperable across multi
ple ledgers. As with conventional payment systems, 
system-wide compliance quality hinges on the least 
rigorous credential issuers. 
Laws may need to be adapted or applied in new 
ways. What justifies triggering a SAR? Under what 
conditions may authorities unmask a user’s iden
tity? Different jurisdictions would likely set distinct 
due-process thresholds. One country might require 
only administrative subpoenas while another 
demands judicial warrants. 
Effective cross-border enforcement of com
pliance relies on cross-jurisdictional cooperation, 
as is true of conventional correspondent banking 
today. For example, Project Mandala is a proposal 
by the Bank for International Settlements for a 
compliance-by-design approach to coordinating 
compliance checks by banks and other financial 
institutions involved in cross-border payments. 
Analogous to the stablecoin compliance-by-design 
approach we have described, Project Mandala uses 
zero-knowledge proofs to establish the validity of 
a bank’s compliance statement without the need 
to share that bank’s compliance-related data with 
other banks involved in the payment. 
We do not propose that stablecoin payment sys
tems be required to adopt a compliance-by-design 
approach. In fact, even if some countries were to 
impose this approach as a regulatory requirement, 
it would be challenging to block domestic access 
to alternative offshore stablecoin systems that do 
not take this approach to privacy and compliance.
 Stablecoins hold significant promise for improv
ing financial inclusion and the efficiency of payment 
systems—and making life harder on modern-day Al 
Capones. But they need to reach a much better bal
ance between privacy and compliance. The compli
ance-by-design approach we have outlined is one 
way to do that. F&D

 Frontiers of Finance
 Optimus: That is clearly defined in the laws and reg
ulations of each country. Depending on the specific 
magine three friends meeting in the Roman forum. 
One is optimistic about technology, one skepti
cal, and one is after the bigger picture. They start 
debating the role of money shaped by innovations 
such as stablecoins, tokenized deposits, central 
bank digital currency (CBDC), and digital finan
cial infrastructure. In a world laced with uncertainty, 
dialogue is paramount. Let’s listen in.
 Optimus: Skeptimus, I just discovered an amazing 
new way to pay for things. From my phone, I can 
transfer money to anyone in the world. It’s instant, 
cheap, and easy. To receive funds, just print a QR 
code or share a number. Even merchants can sign 
up. It’s called a stablecoin. 
Skeptimus: Oh, Optimus, there you go again. It’s just 
another money-transfer app.  
Optimus: No, no, no. You can also hold a balance 
in stablecoins. You don’t need a separate bank 
account. The stablecoin is the bank. 
Skeptimus: It’s not a bank! Banks have vaults, they 
have offices, they insure deposits, they… 
Optimus: OK, you’re right, it’s not a bank. But for 
good reason. Banks offer package deals. They 
issue money—our deposits. At the front end, they 
onboard customers and merchants, and build 
e-banking apps. At the back end, they run data
bases to track our money, message other banks to 
transfer funds, and offer services like fraud detec
tion. Full service. 
Skeptimus: So? I like my bank. I like paying by card. 
And banks are exploring tokenized deposits. 
Optimus: Right, millions are like you. Stablecoin 
companies are a little different. They focus on pro
viding a payment instrument—denominated in dol
lars, euros, yen, and potentially other currencies. 
They mostly leave front- and back-end services to 
others. Stablecoins are recorded and transferred on 
blockchains. And separate digital wallet providers 
take on customers and build apps. That frees up 
each firm in the chain to be more innovative. Of 
course, banks and asset managers are no bystand
ers. They too are exploring ways to make their 
deposits and other assets available on blockchains.
 Skeptimus: What about fraud detection and ensur
ing transactions don’t fund terrorists? 
regulations, various financial companies, including 
stablecoin providers, are required to “know their 
customer” and check for money laundering and 
criminal activity. 
Skeptimus: OK, but what’s in it for users?
 Optimus: Stablecoin companies have racked up mil
lions of users globally, transacting across borders 
around the clock at fairly low cost, and they can scale 
up. That was barely possible even five years ago. 
Skeptimus: I see the creative energy, the growth 
potential, the extra competition—it’s all good. Still, 
stablecoins remain small. They’re mostly used to 
buy crypto assets like Bitcoin—they’re the payment 
instruments of the blockchain world. 
Optimus: True, but they could be used in retail pay
ments if integrated into popular phone apps. They 
could be used for e-commerce, for cross-border 
transactions, to buy securities on blockchains. 
Money market funds and asset managers are start
ing to offer investment products, like exchange 
traded funds, on blockchains. And banks are 
exploring ways to make their deposits transferable 
on the same infrastructure. 
Skeptimus: But are stablecoins safe?
 Optimus: Well, the value of stablecoins fluctuates with 
the value of the assets held by the issuer as reserves. 
And that has motivated policymakers to phase in laws 
and regulations to make stablecoins safer.

Saturn in the

 Stability
 Skeptimus: That’s a good start, but just the first step. 
Is regulation sound? Will supervision be strict? Will 
enforcement curb dubious activity?
 Optimus: Why not? Stablecoin companies want to 
be regulated and trusted.
 Skeptimus: Not all. Some may try to appeal to bad 
actors by offering anonymity. 
Optimus: Those shouldn’t even be allowed to issue. 
They wouldn’t meet regulatory requirements. 
Skeptimus: Ah, but will users be able to distinguish 
stablecoins targeting a fixed value in, say, dollars 
or euros from those intended to represent riskier 
assets? The second type should certainly not be 
considered money—whether most people would

 accept the first as money “no questions asked” is 
also debatable. 
Optimus: Skeptimus, you underestimate my ability 
to tell good from bad! 
Skeptimus: Sorry, don’t take it wrong. Still, even for 
you, I see a risk. There have always been runs on 
private money. As you said earlier, the more sta
ble the reserve assets, the more stable the stable
coins. Treasury bills are good backing assets. But 
even their prices vary as interest rates move. When 
prices decrease too much, users might run from 
stablecoins—especially if they question the exact 
assets being held. 
Optimus: Even bank deposits are risky, as not all of 
them are insured. And stablecoin issuers can hold 
extra capital as a backup. Or what about holding 
even safer and more liquid assets, like central bank 
reserves? 
Skeptimus: Yes, that would be safer. But central 
banks may not want to be involved, or to immobi
lize their reserves. 
Currency risks
 Vastus: Friends, sit down and cast your eyes on the 
horizon. I see two more risks. Even if stablecoins 
are safe and convenient—as you say, Optimus—cit
izens of countries with high inflation, weak curren
cies, or poor payment systems will jump on them. 
Finally, an accessible dollar. Individually, people 
may be better off. Collectively, they could drain 
deposits from their banks and undermine the abil
ity of their central bank to conduct monetary policy 
and stabilize the financial system. What’s the point 
of setting interest rates on a currency no one uses? 
Will stablecoins spell the end of weaker currencies?
 Optimus: You’re right, that is a problem. Then 
again, countries could require stablecoins to be 
held in domestically regulated wallets with limits 
on holdings. 
Skeptimus: Easier said than done. People can hide 
their computer’s location; enforcement is hard in 
a borderless market. 
Optimus: True, but technology is both cat and 
mouse, Skeptimus. It could help enforce, not just 
avoid, limits. Of course, stablecoin issuers would 
need to cooperate with country authorities. 
Vastus: Another risk is fragmentation—the difficulty 
of exchanging one stablecoin for another form of 
money or with another stablecoin. Say you hold Sta
blecoin A, Optimus, and Skeptimus holds Stable
coin B. Optimus, how do you pay Skeptimus? 
Optimus: Click and go… 
Vastus: Not so easy. Skeptimus doesn’t trust coin 
A. He only wants B. And you can’t just convert 
A to B, as A may be backed by a different pool of 
assets—perhaps because it’s regulated differently 
in another country. Or suppose A is recorded on one 
blockchain and B on another, and the two are not 
compatible. There are solutions, but they’re clunky 
and costly. Or perhaps you convince Skeptimus to 
hold coin A after all. But then you have an antitrust 
problem—everyone holding the same coin. 
Central bank reserves
 Optimus: Banks solved this problem long ago. Each 
holds some central bank reserves—a common, safe 
asset—and when one pays the other it transfers 
reserves over the central bank’s payment system. 
Why can’t stablecoins do the same?
 Vastus: In that case, we’re coming back full cir
cle to central bank digital currency. If central 
bank reserves were available to stablecoin issu
ers within the day, just for payments, they could 
ensure interoperability, as Optimus says. Maybe in 
exchange for some additional oversight by the cen
tral bank. Fully backing stablecoins with reserves 
is a different possibility. It’s but a small step away 
from fully exchanging stablecoins for CBDC. 
Optimus: What? You’d do away with all the inno
vation and customer connections that stablecoin 
companies have built?
 Vastus: Not quite. Keep the talent, the innova
tion, the new services. Just do away with the 
creation of money. Leave that to central banks, 
which know how to do it safely. But allow private 
f
 irms to invent ways to distribute the money, to 
transact efficiently, to build financial services. 
Instead of obsessing about the killer application 
for CBDC, and putting that on the shoulders of 
central banks, give wings to the private sector 
to innovate—safely and passionately. It’s a dif
ferent approach—CBDC built for integration  
and innovation.  
Optimus: That’s my kind of optimism! 
Skeptimus: It won’t work. Without a balance sheet, 
or revenue from holding assets like Treasuries, sta
blecoin companies will close.

 Optimus: Not necessarily. They’re already rebating 
most of their revenue to users through incentives, 
and competition will augment that. Plus, they’d 
need to find other revenue sources when Treasury 
yields approach zero in downturns. They’ll figure 
it out. And central banks could provide incentives 
to foster innovation. 
Skeptimus: To grease the wheels of private firms, 
you mean… 
The money road
 Vastus: Now, now—we’re just speculating. Money 
doesn’t exist in a vacuum; except for cash, it is 
recorded on ledgers, the roads on which money 
travels. Roads have held together empires! Infra
structure matters. 
Optimus: Blockchains are the new roads, Vas
tus. They are the ledgers on which stablecoins 
are recorded and transacted. And they can also 
record securities—any asset, really. When money 
and securities are on the same blockchain, you can 
pay for a security at exactly the time you receive it, 
lowering risks of remaining without either. It’s also 
easier to automate, you can trade around the clock 
and across borders, and you don’t need so many 
costly intermediaries.
 Vastus: That assumes proper legal and regulatory 
foundations, which are still being hashed out. 
Hopefully these will be consistent across countries.
 Skeptimus: The real risk is concentration. If a single 
blockchain offers so many advantages, will we end 
up with a massive national or regional blockchain 
recording all assets? Would a dominant stablecoin 
favor one blockchain, then impose its standards on 
everyone else?
 Optimus: Stablecoins are independent of infrastruc
ture. But plans may change. The same stablecoin 
can be reissued on different blockchains. 
Skeptimus: That may be the future, though jumping 
chains is expensive and risky. That’s where cyber
criminals lurk. Then again, stablecoins aside, com
petition among blockchains is healthy, and diver
sity helps. One chain may be better for privacy, 
another for programmability, and a third for speed. 
Vastus: The trick is compatibility. Code written for 
one chain—to establish ownership, swap assets, 
or check identities—should run on another chain. 
Compatibility alleviates the problems of concen
tration and fragmentation. 
Skeptimus: Maybe there’s a role for the public sector: 
to vet the stability and compatibility of blockchains 
and contracts written for them?
 Optimus: Actually, I’d go one step further. If cen
tral bank money is needed on-chain to settle trans
actions for everyone’s peace of mind, then central 
banks can be a catalyst for one blockchain standard 
over another. Everyone will want to be compatible 
with the central bank. Meanwhile, innovation can 
still happen on external, yet compatible, chains. 
Skeptimus: Easier said than done. But that’s the 
direction some central banks are exploring. Things 
are moving fast. 
Optimus: Here’s another idea, perhaps far-fetched, 
to avoid the downsides of concentration but still have 
a single, or few, blockchains and sufficient innova
tion: open-source code and decentralized ownership. 
Thousands of programmers innovating and propos
ing new features, and thousands of computers run
ning the blockchain. No single entity in control but 
still seamless exchange of assets. And no one has to 
pay billions to develop their own blockchain. 
Skeptimus: I would never hold an asset on a block
chain without a customer service number to call. 
Forget it. And what arrangements govern a decen
tralized community, even if well intentioned?
 Optimus: Governance is an issue, so is privacy, but 
solutions are emerging. We must think differently. 
The phone number will be that of your wallet, of 
your broker, or the asset issuer. They could con
trol the assets and take responsibility. Transaction 
rules could be hard-coded into the asset itself and 
automatically enforced. That way everyone could 
potentially transact; whether they’re allowed to is 
another story.   
Vastus: Optimus, you force us to look ahead. But 
perhaps too far, or too fast. We’re talking about per
sonal wealth, financial stability, institutional credi
bility. We may eventually get to where you gaze, or 
elsewhere. Do me a favor, walk hand in hand with 
Skeptimus. Together, you’ll find the right pace and 
course of change. 
Skeptimus: Wise words, Vastus. 
Optimus: And yet, we must move… F&D

 CASE STUDY
 INDIA’S 
FRICTIONLESS 
PAYMENTS 
Alex Copestake, Divya Kirti, and  
María Soledad Martínez Pería 
Y
 ou’re in line at a café. When you reach the 
counter, you tap your phone to pay—only 
to be told, “Sorry, we only take Apple Pay. 
You’re trying to use Google Pay.” You sigh 
and leave without your coffee.
 This minor frustration reveals a major chal
lenge: Digital payments are not always as con
venient as they sound. As is often the case with 
infrastructure—digital or physical—we notice only 
when it doesn’t work well. What’s missing here is 
interoperability: the ability of different payment 
apps, banks, and platforms to connect seamlessly.
 Many digital payment systems are like walled gar
dens. If you and the person you are paying do not use 
the same payment provider, the transaction is not 
possible. Private platforms prefer to keep users within 
their domains, also known as closed-loop systems.
 Interoperability turns walled gardens into public 
squares, where everyone can transact with anyone. 
You use your favorite app, and the other party uses 
theirs—and the payment goes through.
 Our recent research shows that this freedom of 
choice drives two major benefits (Copestake and 
others 2025). The first is a better user experience. 
Consumers choose their favorite apps based on 
what they value, including ease of use, reliability, 
or language options. The second is more innovation. 
Providers must consistently deliver and improve, 
since switching is easy, and users are not locked in.
 Digital acceleration
 Our work draws on India’s rapid transition to dig
ital payments and finds that interoperability can 
empower consumers, foster innovation, and accel
erate the shift away from cash. 
In 2016, the country launched the Unified Pay
ments Interface (UPI), which allows payments to be 
sent and received easily across all participating apps 
and banks. The system has transformed India’s pay
ment landscape and become the largest real-time 
payment system in the world by volume, process
ing more than 19 billion transactions every month. 
Tellingly, most UPI transactions take place 
across different apps, which would not be possible 
if they operated only as closed-loop systems. At the 
same time, cash use has declined. UPI’s is a story 
of digital acceleration unlocked by interoperability.
 Many users initially joined UPI through trusted 
apps, often offered by their banks. The UPI opera
tor also launched BHIM, a simple public app to help 
introduce the system to new users.
 As UPI gained traction, more than 200 apps and 
most banks entered the market. And interopera
bility allowed users to move freely to newer, better 
apps—without having to persuade other users to 
shift at the same time.
 The world’s 
largest real
time payment 
system shows 
the power of 
interoperable 
platforms 
This flexibility meant new entrants could 
both enter more easily and scale up more quickly. 
Incumbents had to raise their game. More reli
able apps—as measured by transaction failure 
rates—pulled in more users. Over time, reliabil
ity improved across the board.
 Driving growth
 But was interoperability critical to the digital pay
ment takeoff, or would it have happened anyway? 
Evidence from two important episodes using new, 
granular data reveals that interoperability did 
indeed play a central role in driving the growth of 
digital payments in India.
 First, India’s banknote demonetization in 
2016 (when the government withdrew vari
ous banknote denominations from circulation) 
pushed many people to try digital payments 
for the first time. Users faced a choice between 
closed-loop apps and the interoperable UPI. They 
largely chose UPI, which saw much more rapid 
growth—driven by cross-app transactions made 
possible by interoperability. 
Second, in 2017, after a regulatory push, a lead
ing closed-loop provider joined UPI, resulting in 
the merger of two large preexisting payment net
works. The result? In districts with the most initial 
fragmentation—and therefore the largest gains 
from this increase in interoperability—digital pay
ments grew faster. 
Users valued the combined network more than 
the sum of its parts: Both networks were used 
more, and transactions between them also picked

 up. Total digital payments rose relative to proxies 
for cash usage.
 Connected networks
 Interoperability was a key driver of India’s success 
in expanding digital payments. But several other 
factors contributed as well. These include a broad 
digital ID system, financial inclusion programs, and 
affordable mobile internet. 
Countries seeking to expand digital payments 
can draw several lessons from India’s experience. It 
starts with building open infrastructure. Interoper
ability can foster user choice and innovation. Next, 
invest in digital enablers. Affordable mobile data, 
national ID systems, and broad access to banking are 
essential. Governments can also support early adop
tion with a public app that helps build momentum.
 It’s also crucial to monitor the market and tai
lor regulation. In India, providers have found ways 
to nudge users—through QR code branding, bun
dled services, and other means—to stay within 
their walled gardens. Today, over 95 percent of UPI 
transactions are initiated using only three apps, and 
in about half of them, both payer and payee use the 
same app. Tracking usage patterns, app dominance, 
and switching costs is critical for authorities to iden
tify the best ways to preserve user choice.
 Back to the café. This time, you can use your 
preferred provider, pay instantly, and walk away 
with your coffee and a digital receipt. That small 
moment of ease—made possible by interoperability 
“India’s UPI is the largest real-time payment 
system in the world by volume, with more 
than 19 billion transactions a month.” 
—is the foundation of a broader digital transforma
tion. It is what allows digital systems to reach every
one on their terms, without creating new silos. 
Done right, interoperability turns fragmented sys
tems into connected networks. It strengthens trust, 
accelerates adoption, and levels the playing field. For 
countries building the future of finance, interopera
bility is not just helpful, it’s fundamental. F&D

ASIA’S CROSS
BORDER 
PAYMENT PUSH
 Nadine Freischlad
 A
 t the edge of Bali’s Pura Tanah Lot, an 
ancient Hindu temple that towers above 
the ocean atop an outcrop of rocks on the 
Indonesian island’s southwestern coast, 
a row of souvenir stalls invites tourists to 
shop for artwork, bracelets, sarongs, and other wares.
 A $2 pair of sunglasses catches a shopper’s eye. 
A buyer can use a mobile wallet app to scan a QR 
code: a faded black-and-white printout taped to a 
glass counter at the back of the stall. After keying in 
the amount and showing the stall owner the trans
action confirmation screen, the sale is complete. No 
cash changes hands; no cards are swiped. 
Seamless QR code payments are common 
across Southeast Asia. Mass adoption occurred 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, when govern
ments urged merchants to move away from cash. 
These payments are convenient for customers and 
much simpler and cheaper for small businesses 
than a formal card-reading device.
 QRIS, Indonesia’s national QR code standard, 
established by the central bank and payment asso
ciation in 2019, does not charge small businesses 
for processing payments below 500,000 rupiah 
($30). Settlement is instant. Transactions above 
this threshold cost just 0.3 percent.
 But there’s a problem: QRIS transactions are still 
limited mostly to domestic use. With a mobile wal
let from outside Indonesia, the sunglasses payment 
probably wouldn’t have gone through. 
Domestic instant payment systems were trans
formative for Southeast Asia, but regulators and 
businesses then “started to recognize the oppor
tunity of connecting them,” says Benjamin Lee, 
interim director of Singapore-based Nexus Global 
Payments (NGP), a nonprofit established by several 
central banks in April 2025 to improve cross-border 
connectivity.
 On one hand, there’s a growing number of 
bilateral links. Thailand and Singapore were the 
f
 irst to establish one, in 2021, linking their instant 
payment systems. Others, such as Singapore and 
India, Thailand and Malaysia, followed. Indone
sia recently announced plans for a QR code link 
beyond the region, with China and Japan. On the 
other hand, there’s an ongoing effort, spearheaded 
by NGP, to create infrastructure for multilateral 
connections to allow all manner of cross-border 
instant payments through a shared node and a 
common system. 
Mobile payment innovation
 After a decade of rapid digitalization, and inspired by 
China and India, Southeast Asia is pushing forward 
with mobile payment innovation. Smartphone adop
tion soared after 2010 and, with it, proliferation of 
Policymakers 
want seamless 
digital transfers 
between 
countries to be 
obstacle-free
 digital platforms for rides, meals, and e-commerce, 
fueled by billions of dollars in venture capital. 
But there was one major source of friction: pay
ments. Card usage, especially credit cards, is low 
in Southeast Asia. This made it difficult to provide 
a secure environment for online transactions. And 
only a fraction of offline merchants had the means 
to install card readers. Most small-scale daily trans
actions used cash, even in major cities.
 Digital platforms needed a better way to move 
money—not just between consumers and mer
chants, but within their own ecosystems of drivers, 
couriers, and sellers. If most ride-hailing drivers 
received cash from passengers, there was no easy 
way for the platforms to take a cut.
 Digital wallets, such as those pioneered by Alib
aba in China and Paytm in India, emerged as a solu
tion for Southeast Asia. They allowed users to store 
money on their phones, making it easy to pay for 
rides, meals, or online orders without handling cash.
 At first, each platform built its own closed-loop 
system. Payments worked smoothly inside the app 
and between its partners. This was efficient for plat
forms but fragmented for consumers and mer
chants. Regulators soon recognized the need for 
open, standardized infrastructure that would allow 
digital payments across platforms and providers. 
Consolidation and standardization

 ment system (IPS) for peer-to-peer transfers. The 
aim, according to Kenneth Gay, chief fintech offi
cer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS),
 was to “provide a safe, simple, and faster way for 
individuals and businesses in Singapore to make 
payment transactions.”
 Similar to India’s Unified Payments Interface 
(UPI), PayNow enables the electronic transfer of 
money to people using only their mobile phone or 
national ID numbers, and to businesses using their 
unique entity numbers—in real time, 24/7, for free.
 Singapore also expanded its existing Network 
for Electronic Transfers (NETS) to support QR code 
payments at regular offline stores. Together, these 
systems created a more open, connected payment 
landscape—one that didn’t rely solely on cards or 
proprietary wallets.
 Other countries followed. Malaysia introduced 
DuitNow and Thailand PromptPay, which both fol
low a similar approach to Singapore’s and support 
UPI-style transfers; Indonesia introduced BI-FAST 
and QRIS. They all aim to unify domestic payments 
under national standards and establish public infra
structure that private fintech firms can use. But, says 
Gay, “Most cross-border payments remained slow, 
opaque, and inefficient, due to their reliance on mul
tiple correspondent banks and other intermediaries.” 
Formally linking national instant payment sys
tems across countries would eliminate fragmenta
tion and, according to MAS, “carry over the benefits 
of cheap, fast, seamless payments from the domes
tic to the cross-border arena.” Travelers and the 
many merchants that cater to them would appre
ciate the convenience of interoperability among 
standardized national QR code systems. 
Allowing international fund transfers using a 
mobile phone or ID number via linked IPSs would 
be even more transformative, and a boon for the 
many families that rely on remittances from rela
tives working elsewhere in the region.

 eral links is too resource-intensive. “Each linkage 
required a refresh in technical alignment between 
the respective two IPSs and alignment in domes
tic policies and requirements, such as on data 
privacy, security, and sanctions screening,” says 
Gay. It took three years of extensive collaboration 
between multiple stakeholders to finalize the 2021 
PayNow–PromptPay linkage.
 Expanding IPS links to a broader network of 
countries becomes more efficient with a multilat
eral payment gateway solution—which is why cen
tral banks and regulators came together to form 
NGP, a gateway designed to standardize the way 
domestic IPSs connect to one another.
 “The Project Nexus idea was originally conceived 
at the Singapore Innovation Hub,” says Lee, referring 
to a Bank for International Settlements initiative that 
promotes new technologies for safer, faster, and more 
connected financial systems. Rather than building 
custom connections for every new country, an IPS 
operator need make only one connection to Nexus to 
As with bilateral linkages, tapping into a sin
gle node through Nexus requires common tech
nical standards, including common operating 
standards and processes that cover approaches 
to data privacy and money laundering safeguards, 
and a consistent commercial model that protects 
the interests of all stakeholders. 
There’s real momentum now, says Lee. “The 
region came together about two years ago, under 
the Indonesian G20 presidency, when the idea of 
regional payments connectivity was made a prior
ity, and has now led to the establishment of NGP 
and a shared desire to scale this network globally 
to other interested and ready jurisdictions.”
 NGP is now focused on foundational work to 
build its capabilities and enable Nexus to go live. It is 
expected to appoint a technical operator to build and 
operate the network this year, according to MAS’s 
Gay. “We expect to see the first live cross-border 
transaction on Nexus around 2027,” he said, before 
expanding to other interested countries.
 Glimpse of the future
 Large-scale adoption of cross-border functionality 
depends on sustained collaboration between gov
ernments, central banks, and fintech players. Smaller 
banks too need to raise their game or risk being left 
behind amid rapid payment industry transformation. 
Many banks in Southeast Asia still “operate 
on legacy systems,” says Arun Kini, managing 
director for Asia-Pacific payments at fintech firm 
Finastra, which specializes in helping banks meet 
the latest technical and regulatory requirements. 
Banks can benefit from tapping into burgeoning 
IPSs, but their popularity has also “become a bot
tleneck for the banks,” posing problems for those 
that don’t have the technology to tap into them, 
says Kini.
 So while there’s progress, NGP’s vision of a 
cross-border payment landscape in which peo
ple, banks, and fintech firms can effortlessly move 
money to each other across borders may take time. 
In the meantime, innovative technology is still pop

 CASE STUDY
 FIGHTING 
TECH-FUELED 
CRIME
 Chady El Khoury
 T
 he Department of Justice in June 
announced the largest-ever US crypto 
seizure: $225 million from crypto scams 
known as pig butchering, in which orga
nized criminals, often across borders, use 
advanced technology and social engineering such 
as romance or investment schemes to manipulate 
victims. This typically involves using AI-generated 
profiles, encrypted messaging, and obscured block
chain transactions to hide and move stolen funds. 
It was a big win. Federal agents collaborated 
across jurisdictions and used blockchain analysis 
and machine learning to track thousands of wal
lets used to scam more than 400 victims. Yet it was 
also a rare victory that underscored how authorities 
often must play catch-up in a fast-changing digital 
world. And the scammers are still out there. 
Criminals are outpacing enforcement by adapt
ing ever faster. They pick the best tools for their 
schemes, from laundering money through crypto 
and AI-enabled impersonation to producing deep
fake content, encrypted apps, and decentralized 
exchanges. Authorities confronting anonymous, 
borderless threats are held back by jurisdiction, pro
cess, and legacy systems. 
Annual illicit crypto activity growth has aver
aged about 25 percent in recent years and may have 
surpassed $51 billion last year, according to Chain
alysis, a New York–based blockchain analysis firm 
specializing in helping criminal investigators trace 
transactions.
 Bad actors still depend on cash and traditional 
f
 inance, and money laundering specifically relies on 
banks, informal money changers, and cash couriers. 
But the old ways are being reinforced or supercharged 
by technologies to thwart detection and disruption. 
Encrypted messaging apps help cartels coor
dinate cross-border transactions. Stablecoins and 
lightly regulated virtual asset platforms can hide 
bribes and embezzled funds. Cybercriminals use 
AI-generated identities and bots to deceive banks 
and evade outdated controls. Tracking proceeds 
generated by organized crime is nearly impossible 
for underresourced agencies.
 AI lowers barriers to entry. Fraudsters with 
voice-cloning and fake-document generators bypass 
the verification protocols many banks and regulators 
still use. Their innovation is growing as compliance 
systems lag. Governments recognize the threats, but 
responses are fragmented and uneven—including in 
regulation of crypto exchanges. And there are delays 
implementing the Financial Action Task Force’s 
(FATF’s) “travel rule” to better identify those send
ing and receiving money across borders, which most 
digital proceeds cross.
 Meanwhile, international financial flows are 
increasingly complicated by instant transfers on 
decentralized platforms and anonymity-enhancing 
tools. Most payments still go through multiple inter
mediaries, often layering cross-border transactions 
through antiquated correspondent banks that 
obscure and delay transactions while raising costs. 
This helps criminals exploit oversight gaps, jurisdic

tional coordination, and technological capacity to

 Safe payment corridors
 There’s a parallel narrative. Criminals exploit inno
vation for secrecy and speed while companies and 
governments test coordination to reduce vulner
abilities and modernize cross-border infrastruc
ture. At the same time, technological implications 
remain underexplored with respect to anti–money 
laundering and countering the financing of terror
ism, or AML/CFT. 
Singapore’s and Thailand’s linked fast payment 
systems, for example, enable real-time retail trans
fers using mobile numbers; Indonesia and Malay
sia have connected QR codes for cross-border 
payments. Such innovations offer efficiency and 
inclusion yet raise new issues regarding identity 
verification, transaction monitoring, and regulatory 
coordination (see “Southeast Asia’s Cross-Border 
Payment Push” in this issue of F&D).
 In India, the Unified Payments Interface enables 
seamless transfers across apps and platforms, high
lighting the power of interoperable design. More 
than 18 billion monthly transactions, many across 
competing platforms, show how openness and 
standardization drive scale and inclusion. Digital

payments in India grew faster when interopera
bility improved, especially in fragmented markets 
where switching was costly, IMF research shows (see 
“India’s Frictionless Payments” in this issue of F&D). 
These regional innovations and global initiatives 
reflect a growing understanding that fighting crime 
and fostering inclusion are interlinked priorities—
 especially as criminals speed ahead. The FATF 
echoed this concern, urging countries to design 
AML/CFT controls that support inclusion and inno
vation. Moreover, an FATF June recommendation 
marks a major advance: Requiring originator and 
beneficiary information for cross-border wire trans
fers—including those involving virtual assets—will 
enhance traceability across the fast-evolving digital 
f
 inancial ecosystem. 
Efforts like these are important examples of how 
technology enables criminal advantage, but tech
nology must also be part of the regulatory response. 
Modernizing cross-border payment systems and 
reducing unintended AML/CFT barriers increasingly 
means focusing on transparency, interoperability, and 
risk-based regulation. The IMF’s work on “safe pay
ment corridors” supports this by helping countries 
build trusted, secure channels for legitimate finan
cial flows without undermining new technology. A 
pilot with Samoa—where de-risking has disrupted 
remittances—showed how targeted safeguards and 
collaboration with regulated providers can preserve 
access while maintaining financial integrity without 
disrupting the use of new payment platforms.
 Machine learning
 Several countries, with IMF guidance, are invest
ing in machine learning to detect anomalies in 
cross-border financial flows, and others are tight
ening regulation of virtual asset service providers. 
Governments are investing in their own capacity 
to trace crypto transfers, and blockchain analytics 
f
 irms are often employed to do that.
 IMF analysis of cross-border flows and the 
updated FATF rules are mutually reinforcing. If 
implemented cohesively, they can help digital effi
ciency coexist with financial integrity. For that to 
happen, legal frameworks must adapt to enable 
timely access to digital evidence while preserving 
due process. Supervisory models need to evolve to 
oversee both banks and nonbank financial institu
tions offering cross-border services. Regulators and 
f
 intechs should be partners, and sustained multilat
eral engagement should foster fast, cheap, transpar
ent, and traceable cross-border payments—anchored 
interoperable standards that also respect privacy.
 Governments must keep up. That means invest
ing in regulatory technology, such as AI-powered 
transaction monitoring and blockchain analysis, 
and giving agencies tools and expertise to detect 
complex crypto schemes and synthetic identity 
fraud. Institutions must keep pace with criminals 
by hiring and retaining expert data scientists and 
f
 inancial crime specialists. Virtual assets must be 
brought under AML/CFT regulation, public-pri
vate partnerships should codevelop tools to spot 
emerging risks, and global standards from the FATF 
and the Financial Stability Board must be backed 
by national investments in effective AML/CFT 
frameworks. 
Consistent and coordinated implementation is 
important. Fragmented efforts leave openings for 
criminals. Their growing technological advantage 
over governments threatens to undermine financial 
integrity, destabilize economies, weaken already 
fragile institutions, and erode public trust in sys
tems meant to ensure safety and fairness. As crime 
rings adopt and adapt emerging technologies to 
outpace enforcement, the cost is not only fiscal—it 
is structural and systemic. Governments can’t wait. 
The criminals won’t. F&D

 How the Battle for 
Control Could Crush 
AI’s Promise
 Carl Benedikt Frey
 A SHIFT TOWARD CENTRALIZATION AND CONCENTRATION 
COULD SNUFF OUT TECHNOLOGY’S PRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL
 In the mid-20th century, the Soviet Union’s tech
nological successes, notably launching Sputnik 
and sending Yuri Gagarin into space, convinced 
many observers that centrally planned econo
mies might outperform market-driven ones. 
Prominent economists such as Paul Samuelson 
predicted that the USSR would soon overtake the 
United States economically, while Oskar Lange, a 
Polish economist and socialist, argued that emerg
ing computer technologies could effectively replace 
the outdated market mechanism.
 Yet, paradoxically, the USSR collapsed just as the 
computer revolution took off. Despite considerable 
investments—including Nikita Khrushchev’s attempt 
to create a Soviet counterpart to Silicon Valley on the 
edge of Moscow in Zelenograd—the USSR failed to 
harness the promise of computing technology. The 
obstacle was not a shortage of scientific talent, but 
institutions inhospitable to exploration. Whereas Sili
con Valley thrived on decentralized experimentation, 
with inventors job-hopping among start-ups running 
multiple concurrent experiments, innovation in Zel
enograd was centrally controlled and orchestrated 
entirely by Moscow government officials.
 As Friedrich Hayek argued, the main difficulty 
with central planning wasn’t processing data but 
gathering essential local knowledge. Soviet plan
ners could manage standardized operations but 
faltered during technological uncertainty, lacking 
benchmarks to monitor factory performance and 
punish slackers. Despite early rapid growth, the 
USSR stagnated, unable to adapt to new techno
logical frontiers, and eventually collapsed.
 These insights are still relevant, particularly as 
new forms of artificial intelligence again raise the 
question of whether centralized authority, such as 
China’s AI-driven surveillance state, or corporate 
concentration—as among Silicon Valley’s big tech 
companies—can leverage new technologies effec
tively to manage the economy and society.

Frontier innovation
 Conventional theories of wealth and poverty that 
emphasize factors like geography, culture, or insti
tutions struggle to explain dramatic economic 
reversals. Geographic conditions, which remained 
unchanged, cannot account for the USSR’s shift from 
rapid growth to collapse. Cultural factors also evolve 
too slowly to explain swift economic booms and sub
sequent busts. While institutions such as laws and 
regulations can change more abruptly, institutional 
theories based on universal conditions are similarly 
incomplete; for instance, both the USSR and China 
experienced decades of rapid growth despite lacking 
secure private property rights. Ultimately, under
standing economic progress requires examining how 
institutions and culture interact dynamically with 
technological changes.
 Recognizing that economic performance is tied 
to this shifting interaction reframes the familiar 
policy debate over technological progress. One side 
advocates decentralized innovation driven by small 
f
 irms in lightly regulated markets; the other pro
motes state-led industrial policy executed by pow
erful bureaucracies. However, both approaches are 
optimal only under certain conditions: Central
ized bureaucracies effectively exploit accessible 
technologies and drive catch-up growth, whereas 
decentralized systems excel at pioneering innova
tions at the technological frontier. Over time, eco
nomic governance must adapt or risk stagnation.
 Japan as Number One
 Even when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, 
America’s relief was tempered by a new anxiety: 
Many scholars and journalists believed that Japan 
would soon eclipse the US. Ezra Vogel’s 1979 best
seller, Japan as Number One, had already warned of 
Tokyo’s growing edge in computers and semicon
ductors, a gain seemingly as dramatic as its earlier 
rise in automobiles. Yet the computer revolution

 that followed told a different story. From the early 
1990s US software-driven productivity soared, 
while Japanese firms clung stubbornly to hardware.
 Japan’s ascent had rested on a tightly coordi
nated production system. Because Japanese firms 
could take equity stakes in their suppliers—some
thing US antitrust law discouraged—they wove 
dense knowledge networks reinforced by just-in
time logistics, computer-aided design, and repro
grammable machine tools. The result was striking 
efficiency: Japanese autoworkers were 17 percent 
more productive than their US counterparts by 
1980, leading Ford and GM to report steep losses.
 The Japanese edge, however, came less from 
inventing new products than from refining Western 
ones. Color televisions, the Walkman, and VCRs 
became global hits only after Japanese engineers 
reengineered them for cost and durability. In a sem
inal study, economist Edwin Mansfield found that 
roughly two-thirds of Japanese R&D targeted pro
cess improvements—the mirror image of the prod
uct-heavy US effort—allowing faster translation of 
laboratory advances into cheap, marketable goods.
 But those very strengths became limitations. 
Eminent observers such as Alfred Chandler Jr. had 
expected the computer age to reward hardware 
perfection and streamlined production—factors 
that favored Japan—but it was the dynamism of US 
start-ups like Apple and Microsoft that proved deci
sive. US antitrust policy, rooted in the 1890 Sher
man Antitrust Act, pried open markets by forcing 
IBM to unbundle its hardware and software and 
by breaking up AT&T just before the commer
cial internet took off. Without a single gatekeeper, 
entrepreneurs could innovate freely, and the web 
expanded unimpeded.
 Japan’s looser competition rules, by contrast, 
fostered cartelization and entrenched keiretsu 
conglomerates. The same coordination that once 
sped incremental upgrades now slowed the leap 
to software and internet-based business models, 
crowding out new entrants. Japan’s technological 
momentum stalled. Even within the US, regions 
organized around fierce competition, such as Sil
icon Valley, outperformed more hierarchical, ver
tically integrated areas like New England’s Route 
128 tech cluster.
 End of coordinated capitalism
 Japan is not an isolated example. After World War 
II, Western Europe’s economy grew quickly by 
adopting US methods of mass production across 
a broad range of industries. This strategy worked 
well for several decades, but by the 1970s, Europe 
had exhausted the backlog of American technology. 
To maintain growth, it would need to shift toward 
a model based on innovation rather than merely 
catch up with existing technologies.
 This shift proved challenging. Europe’s eco
nomic institutions were shaped by a long history 
of industrial catch-up, established in the late 19th 
century to absorb British technology and reinforced 
during the postwar era when Europe was closing the 
gap with the US. These institutions were designed 
to support stable and predictable economic growth 
through careful planning, coordinated industries, 
and close cooperation between businesses, banks, 
and governments. Such coordinated capitalism was 
effective when the task was clear—catching up with 
established industrial practices—but became an 
obstacle when faced with the uncertainty and dis
ruption caused by the computer revolution and new 
information technologies.
 In France, the government’s system of indica

 tive planning, which set economic targets to coor
dinate investments, worked well with incremental 
and predictable technological progress. But with 
rapid technological change, planners were over
whelmed and unable to forecast accurately and 
direct resources effectively. 
Similarly, Italy’s state-owned enterprises, cru
cial during the postwar boom, proved rigid and 
unresponsive to a new age of technological turbu
lence. In Spain and Portugal, the heavy influence 
of the state, combined with entrenched interests, 
severely limited economic flexibility, hampering 
innovation and adaptation. Consequently, these 
Southern European nations experienced prolonged 
economic stagnation during the computer revolu
tion, often referred to as “two lost decades.”
 From Hayek to Moravec
 The lesson is clear: Economic miracles stall when 
the institutions that enabled past successes become 
misaligned with new challenges. The Soviet Union 
and much of Europe stumbled when rigid mass pro
duction models failed to adapt to the unpredictabil
ity of the computer age, while Japan faltered as the 
epicenter of innovation shifted from hardware to 
software. Today, China’s growth is increasingly 
constrained by tightened party control, and the 
US faces a similar peril whenever monopoly power 
remains unchecked. The danger that centraliza
tion and concentration will snuff out innovation 
now hangs over AI. Because AI performance has 
historically improved mainly by scaling up com
puting power and data availability, many observers 
concluded that AI is a contest best left to a handful 
of  “national champions.” That belief is seductive—
 and mistaken.

10,000-fold in scale between 2019 and 2024 yet

problem-solving abilities. Meanwhile, leaner 
approaches such as program search (which gener
ates explicit programs to solve tasks) have topped 
20 percent, and newer in-context learning meth
ods (where models learn from examples without 
retraining) are racing ahead.
 Nor will AI soon make human exploration obso
lete. Hans Moravec’s old observation still holds: 
What is effortless for humans (such as walking a 
trail) remains hard for machines, and vice versa. 
Language models trained on the entire internet still 
lack the sensorimotor experience of any four-year
old. Until we can encode that embodied knowledge, 
centralized AI systems will trail the decentralized 
experimentation billions of humans perform daily.
 Ingenuity flourishes precisely where precedent 
is thin. Inventors, scientists, and entrepreneurs 
thrive on turning the unknown into opportunity. By 
contrast, large language models default to statisti
cal consensus. Imagine an LLM trained in 1633—it 
would steadfastly uphold Earth as the universe’s 
center; given 19th century literature, it would con
f
 idently deny that humans could ever fly, echoing 
the long list of failed trials that preceded the Wright 
brothers’ success. Even Google DeepMind’s Demis 
Hassabis admits reaching true artificial general 
intelligence may need “several more innovations.”
 Control and competition
 Those are unlikely to emerge from centralized 
scale alone; they will come, as before, from wid
ening the arena of experimentation and lowering 
the barriers to entry. However, in the age of AI, 
both China and the US are moving in the opposite 
direction, increasing central control and reducing 
competitive dynamism.
 China’s most dynamic sectors remain driven 
by private or foreign-backed firms, while state
owned enterprises lag. Yet Beijing is recentralizing 
authority: Licenses, credit, and contracts now favor 
politically reliable conglomerates, antitrust law is 
wielded selectively, and anti-corruption campaigns 
make loyalty a prerequisite for survival.  Once-vital 
provincial experimentation has withered as offi
cials chase crude indicators such as patent counts, 
f
 looding registries with low-value filings. Patronage 
is eclipsing transparent rules, and loyalty is displac
ing competence, eroding the state’s capacity to nur
ture frontier-level innovation and pushing the econ
omy toward slower, less-innovation-driven growth.
 talent pool and a government deeply committed 
to technological advancement. But as in Western 
countries, firms lacking strong political connec
tions—such as the AI start-up DeepSeek—prove 
most innovative. Although authorities might per
mit these companies to operate with relative auton
omy as long as their activities align with national 
goals, the absence of robust legal protections leaves 
them vulnerable to shifts in political priorities. Con
sequently, firms must invest resources in building 
political alliances, diverting attention and capital 
from driving innovation. And the government’s 
control over critical information technologies 
frequently tempts authorities to strengthen their 
political dominance over society, potentially sti
f
 ling grassroots innovation.
 The US shows the same symptoms in differ
ent guise. Since the computer era of the 1990s, its 
industries have grown markedly more concen
trated, undercutting the fluid competition that 
once characterized Silicon Valley. A web of non
compete clauses now hampers labor mobility, curbs 
the flow of tacit knowledge, and discourages sci
entists and engineers from founding rival firms. 
Because start-ups are central to translating labo
ratory insights into commercial products, this drag 
on talent circulation weakens the very mechanism—
 creative destruction—that reallocates market share 
toward fresh ideas. Economists Germán Gutiér
rez and Thomas Philippon show that the trend is 
driven less by unavoidable scale economies than 
by incumbent lobbying that hard-codes regulatory 
advantages, from patent extensions to sector-spe
cific licensing hurdles.
 This pattern also threatens AI. Beneath today’s 
veneer of intense competition, Microsoft’s deep 
alliance with OpenAI already controls about 70 
percent of the commercial LLM market, while 
Nvidia provides about 92 percent of the special
ized graphics-processing units (GPUs) used to train 
these models. Together with Alphabet, Amazon, 
and Meta, these incumbents have also been quietly 
buying stakes in promising AI start-ups. Sustain
ing a policy regime that safeguards the competitive 
arena itself, rather than the fortunes of particular 
f
 irms, is essential if the next generation of transfor
mative innovators is to deliver the promised boost 
to productivity. That’s as true for the AI age as it 
was for the computer era. F&D

 The Shifting 
Geography of Start-ups
 Swati Bhatt
 US ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY IS MIGRATING FROM 
TRADITIONAL HUBS LIKE CALIFORNIA TO MORE RURAL 
WESTERN AND SOUTHERN STATES
 In Laramie, Wyoming, start-up Airloom Energy 
is reimagining traditional wind turbine design. 
Instead of three-bladed turbines atop tall tow
ers, the company’s system uses wing-like blades 
traveling along a horizontal oval track like a 
roller coaster. This technology is more compact and 
easier to transport than traditional turbines, with 
lower costs. The company plans to break ground 
this year on a pilot project.
 Airloom is not alone. Wyoming, the least popu
lous US state, has seen 50 percent growth in start-ups 
over the past decade. The state is one of the winners 
as entrepreneurial activity has dispersed geographi
cally in recent years, spurred by the adoption of arti
f
 icial intelligence technology (AI tech) and the shift 
to remote and hybrid work. 
In the US, innovation hubs such as New York 
and California’s Silicon Valley are giving way to 
new geographies. Small businesses are popping 
up across western and southeastern states, such 
as Wyoming and Georgia. Seven of the top ten 
states in entrepreneurial activity are south of the 
famed Mason-Dixon Line—the historic bound
ary between Northern and Southern states—or 
the 36th parallel, a more southerly demarcation 
line (Chart 1). 
Start-up clusters
 The decentralization of innovation has enabled 
smaller cities and rural areas to develop start-up 
clusters. Some of these reflect the proliferation of 
data centers in regions with abundant land, electric 
power, and water—and, crucially, friendly local reg
ulations. Western states may lack water, but they 
more than make up for it with the regulatory envi
ronment tech companies want. 
JPMorgan Chase and Starwood Property Trust 
have committed $2 billion for a 100-acre data center 
development in West Jordan, Utah, near Salt Lake 
City. JPMorgan Chase made a loan of $2.3 billion in 
January 2025 for a facility in Abilene, Texas. Meta 
plans to build an $800 million, 715,000-square
foot data center in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Amazon 
is building two data centers in Madison County, 
Mississippi, for a total cost of $10 billion. Google 
is building a $2 billion center in Fort Wayne, Indi
ana, and a $1 billion center in Virginia. 
Data centers act as a focal point for start-ups, fos
tering an entrepreneurial culture that applauds and 
even encourages risk taking. Moreover, a sociocul
tural mindset stemming from geographic proximity 
of firms along the AI tech supply chain encourages 
entrepreneurs to experiment and innovate rapidly.

 Observing peers’ success in taking risks reinforces 
experimentation and calculated risk taking.
 Advances in AI tech have spurred the formation 
and growth of ancillary businesses. AI tech enables 
start-ups to perform tasks traditionally dominated 
by large corporations, such as analyzing massive 
datasets or automating complex processes. 
Productivity increases
 Innovation lies at the heart of productivity 
increases as new technologies encourage busi
nesses to adopt new operational styles. For exam
ple, medical offices in Boise, Idaho, can use AI tech 
to read X-rays without the need for a large hospital. 
Manufacturing firms leverage advanced analytics 
to manage inventory. Workers in remote Wyoming 
use AI tech to streamline processes like data entry, 
scheduling, and email management. According to 
PitchBook, which maintains a database on global 
capital markets, AI start-ups racked up 22 percent of 
f
 irst-time venture capital financing in 2024. 
Start-ups and new businesses have the agility to 
easily incorporate new technologies, unconstrained 
by legacy frameworks. According to Emin Dinlersoz 
and Nathan Goldschlag, writing for the US Census 
Bureau, “since the early fall of 2023, the smallest firms 
had a relatively high AI use rate, although the rate of 
increase was lower than for larger firms.” Correspond
ingly, an increase in start-ups often leads to higher 
labor productivity and potentially higher wages.
 The Census Bureau’s Business Formation Sta
tistics collect data on business applications, a good 
way of measuring idea generation that leads to busi
ness start-ups. As Chart 2 indicates, there has been 
an explosion in new business applications since the 
onset of the pandemic in 2020.
 Another metric uses Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS) data on planned wage payouts to measure the 
launch of new businesses. Whereas Census data 
highlight idea formation, the BLS data capture idea 
implementation. A key question in examining inno
vation is whether an idea becomes significant only 
when it leads to hiring or whether the birth of the 
idea itself qualifies as innovation. 
The BLS data also show a sharp increase in 
entrepreneurial activity across the US during 2010
20 compared with the previous decade. Of the 15 
top performing states, 10—California, Colorado, 
Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, South Dakota, 
Texas, Utah, and Washington—lie west of the Mis
sissippi River. Conversely, the 15 weakest-perform
ing states are located east of the Mississippi.
 Economic dynamism
 Before the pandemic, there was sizable entrepre

 be changing though. Census data show that 7 of the 
top 10 states for start-up activity in 2010–25 were in

 lina, and Cummings Research Park in Huntsville, 
Alabama—the second-largest research park, with 
the South, as the map shows.
 The question is whether all this start-up activity 
is contributing significantly to job growth. Recent 
research published by the Federal Reserve suggests 
that the recent wave of start-ups is less likely than pre
vious upsurges to contribute to employment growth. 
Young, high-growth start-ups accounted for less than 
6 percent of employment in 2024, compared with 
almost 10 percent in 1985, according to the Fed. AI 
tech–driven start-ups tend to be capital- and skill-in
tensive, requiring fewer workers.
 Productivity and wage increases manifest in the 
highest-skilled workers; automation reduces the 
wages of those engaged in routine tasks. Economic 
dynamism—whereby new businesses boost eco
nomic growth—may well reflect not so much large 
start-ups employing large numbers of workers as 
an increase in the number of start-ups, each one 
spawning more such firms thanks to a boost in the 
region’s risk-taking culture.
 This may help explain why population density 
is unrelated to entrepreneurial activity. Among the 
top 10 states for start-up activity, New Mexico and 
Wyoming have between 5 and 20 people per square 
mile. By contrast, Florida and Texas, also in the top 
10, are among the most populous states, with 150 to 
400 people per square mile.
 In addition, larger firms often acquire start-up 
founders’ ideas, which reduces the need for inde
pendent growth. For example, Microsoft acquired 
all of Inflection AI, and its entire 70-person work
force, in 2024, and in 2022 acquired Nuance Com
munications, a leader in speech recognition and 
conversational AI. 
Targeted investing
 This shift in activity from the Western states to 
the South Atlantic states in the postpandemic 
years is remarkable. Key reasons behind this trend 
include venture capital reallocation, aggressive 
state-led incentives (tax breaks and public-private 
R&D partnerships), cost-of-living advantages, 
enhanced ecosystem building (incubators), and 
remote work trends. The Southeastern states’ more 
nuanced approach to investing—writing smaller, 
more directed checks to promising founders—has 
proved to be more resilient in the face of high exit 
rates for start-ups. 
Manufacturing and research are important 
drivers. Automobile manufacturing clusters, led 
by Mercedes-Benz USA and Porsche North Amer
ica, have headquarters in the Atlanta, Georgia, 
area. The 7,000-acre research cluster in Research 
Triangle Park in Raleigh-Durham, North Caro
business incubators and Fortune 500 companies—
 have generated favorable spillover effects in the 
areas’ business climate. Most of these start-ups 
are integrating AI tech into their normal business 
functions: It is a tool in the general toolbox, as 
illustrated by the multibillion-dollar deals made 
by OpenAI with gaming company Epic Games and 
the fintech OneTrust in 2020, both headquartered 
in the Southeast.
 The case of Wyoming is unique. Wyoming 
has no state income tax or corporate income tax, 
low business formation costs and filing fees, and 
no citizenship or residency requirements. The 
state has strong privacy protections as it doesn’t 
share business or personal records with outside 
agencies. In 2023, the Wyoming Banking Board 
approved a cryptocurrency bank. Small won

 der that entrepreneurs consider Wyoming a top 
choice for start-ups. 
Innovation and entrepreneurial activity are 
not inherently confined to historically established 
regions. Emerging areas can cultivate and adapt 
their entrepreneurial ecosystems to harness local 
potential and evolve into dynamic start-up hubs. 
This ability makes them a compelling model for 
less-developed economies seeking to stimulate 
economic growth through entrepreneurship. There 
are nevertheless challenges, such as the need to 
provide cheap energy and other resources to power 
data centers and other power-hungry facilities. Pol
icymakers can play a critical role through targeted 
industrial policy—investing in infrastructure, edu
cation, and regulatory frameworks that foster inno
vation and lower entry barriers for new ventures in 
these regions. F&D

Uncertainty
 Hites Ahir, Nicholas Bloom, and Davide Furceri 
MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY DON’T QUITE MEASURE UP
 Amid this year’s geopolitical rifts, one sig
nal of uncertainty is flashing red; another, 
green; and a third, amber. Ordinarily, they 
tend to track one another.
 This is no parlor game. High levels of 
uncertainty can freeze investment and consump
tion, tank markets, and help spark a recession.
 What are we to make of this in assessing the 
direction of the global economy? 
Let’s start with a review of how economists, 
investors, and policymakers gauge uncertainty.
 How high is uncertainty?
 Measuring uncertainty is not easy. The questions 
are uncertainty about whom, over what, and for 
what time period. There is no single dominant met
ric for uncertainty. 
The three main measures rely on textual analy
sis, financial markets, and business surveys. Text
based measures now show exceptionally high 
levels of uncertainty. Everything you read, from 
newspapers to country reports to official publica
tions, seems to discuss uncertainty. Financial-mar
ket-based measures, meanwhile, show only mod
erate levels of uncertainty. And survey-based 
measures, which spiked during the pandemic, have 
largely flatlined. 
Perhaps the best-known text-based metric is 
the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) Index 
developed by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016). 
The index analyzes articles in hundreds of news
papers for mentions of terms related to econom
ics, policy, and uncertainty. This century, the EPU 
for the United States has typically surged during 
crises, spiking after events like the 2008 financial 
crisis and the 2020 COVID pandemic (Chart 1). In 
2025, the EPU reached a record high, indicating 
extensive discussions of uncertainty in national 
and local newspapers.
 One concern with the EPU is that it may reflect 
media bias. We developed a second set of indicators 
based on the Economist Intelligence Unit’s coun
try reports (Ahir, Bloom, and Furceri 2022). These 
reports appear monthly and provide a detailed

 discussion of political and economic conditions in 
71 countries. By calculating the frequency of the 
appearance of the term “uncertain,” we created the 
World Uncertainty Index (WUI). It shows a similar 
trajectory as the EPU, suggesting that perceptions 
of elevated uncertainty—across countries—are not

 solely media-driven. 
Concerns about using textual data to measure 
uncertainty include the evolution of language, 
potential bias in sources, and inaccuracies in word 
counts as measures of intensity. An alternative 
approach is to examine financial market volatility. 
The 32-year-old Chicago Board Options Exchange 
Volatility Index, known as the VIX, embodies 
this concept. It calculates the one-month-ahead 
implied volatility of the S&P 500 Index of US stocks, 
based on a basket of put and call options. 
Significant spikes in the VIX over the past three 
decades occurred around economic and political 
shocks, such as the Asian and Russian financial 
crises in 1997 and 1998, the 2008 financial crisis, 
the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, and the 2020 pandemic 
(Chart 2). In 2025, the VIX has been elevated—
 reaching 32 in April—but that was not a large spike 
compared with previous jumps. 
Other market-based measures—such as the 
Intercontinental Exchange Bank of America MOVE 
Index of implied volatility on bond yields—pres
ent a similar picture of increased but not extreme 
uncertainty.
 In many ways, the most informative measure 
of uncertainty is how managers perceive future 
business conditions. Ultimately, it is uncertainty 
in the minds of executives that influences deci

 sions about hiring and investment, which drive 
economic growth. 
The US Survey of Business Uncertainty (SBU), 
administered by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, 
queries almost 1,000 US businesses each month, 
collecting information about sales forecasts. As 
Altig and others (2020) show, these forecasts accu
rately predict business actions, including current 
and future hiring, investment, and sales. 
This metric showed a significant surge in uncer
tainty during the pandemic, roughly doubling 
between January and May 2020, before slowly eas
ing (Chart 3). Through June 2025, there was no uncer
tainty surge. One explanation is that businesses may 
not be following the economic or political news. 
However, the SBU panel did notably raise predic
tions for sales growth after the November 2024 
election of Donald Trump. The forecasts declined 
in spring 2025 after the beginning of tariff wars. 
The UK’s Decision Maker Panel collects simi
lar measures of company-level sales growth uncer
tainty. It polls about 2,500 businesses a month 
across the UK. As Chart 3 also shows, the UK sales 
uncertainty index followed a pattern similar to that 
of the US measure, with a surge during the pan
demic but no recent increase. 
It’s a little puzzling that the survey-based met
rics don’t show a rise through June 2025, whereas 
the market-based measures increased moderately 
and the text-based indicators surged. These indices 
tracked each other remarkably closely over previ
ous episodes, such as the pandemic and the finan
cial crisis. One explanation is that text measures 
are excessively high because of the intense media 
focus on the Trump administration. Another is that 
because our financial and business measures are 
shorter term and US-focused, they may miss the 
rise in longer-term global uncertainty. Our sense 
is that the truth is somewhere in between—global 
uncertainty has risen, but not as much as text-based 
measures would suggest.
 Uncertainty and growth 
Economists have been developing theories for 
decades about the economic impact of uncertainty. 
One body of research focuses on “real options,” 
or the idea that companies look at their invest
ment choices as a series of options. For example, a 
supermarket chain that owns a plot of land has the 
option to build a new store there. If the supermar
ket becomes uncertain about the future because 
it is unsure whether a local housing development 
will proceed, it may opt to wait. In such a case, the 
option value of delay is high when uncertainty is 
high. Uncertainty makes businesses cautious about 
investment and hiring.

F&D
 helping to drive business cycles. These effects seem 
sal. They arise only when decisions cannot be eas
ily reversed. Even when uncertainty is high, busi
nesses may be happy to hire part-time employees 
or rent rather than buy equipment. If conditions 
deteriorate, they can easily cut the workers and 
return the rented gear. High uncertainty tends to 
both reduce overall activity and shift it into more 
reversible choices. 
Uncertainty can also push individuals to post
pone consumption. People can easily delay deci
sions on buying durables like housing, cars, and 
furniture. Someone thinking about moving to 
another house could either do so this year or wait 
until next year. The option value of waiting will be 
much higher when income uncertainty is greater. 
Finally, uncertainty can increase the cost of

 inance (Fernandez-Villaverde and others 2011). 
Investors want to be compensated for higher risk, 
and because greater uncertainty leads to higher risk 
premiums, it raises the cost of borrowing. Uncer
tainty also increases the probability of default. 
There is a growing body of research estimating 
the impact of uncertainty on businesses, consum
ers, and the overall economy. Findings generally 
show that greater uncertainty has a strong impact 
on reducing investment and a weaker effect on low

 to be magnified when financial conditions are tight: 
Uncertainty and financial frictions can have a mul
tiplicative impact on each other. 
Clearly, a surge in uncertainty of the size 
implied by this year’s text-based measures could be 
extremely damaging for growth, potentially lead
ing to a global recession. But a rise in uncertainty 
of the size signaled by financial markets might only 
slow growth without generating a recession. And, if 
the business surveys are correct, uncertainty has 
changed little over the past year. 
Our best guess is that uncertainty is not as high 
as indicated by the text measures, which may be 
distorted by the turmoil in US politics. But uncer
tainty is not as low as suggested by business sur
veys focusing on year-ahead sales. Many drivers 
of uncertainty are longer term or will not manifest 
in sales. 
We see uncertainty as having risen above its 
long-term levels without reaching the peaks of the 
global financial crisis or the pandemic. As such, 
we think the 2025 surge in uncertainty will slow 
growth by reducing investment, hiring, and con
sumer spending on durable goods. This is likely 
to happen through 2025 and 2026 as the impact of 
uncertainty typically takes 6 to 18 months to slow 
growth (Caldara and Iacoviello 2022). But the rise 
in uncertainty is not large enough to induce a global 
recession. F&D

 When Free Trade  
First Faltered
 Marc-William Palen
 GLOBALIZATION’S FIRST AGE SOME 200 YEARS AGO HELD 
CONTRADICTIONS THAT SHED LIGHT ON TODAY’S TURN 
TOWARD ECONOMIC NATIONALISM
 The “first age” of globalization was beset 
by contradictions. In the 60 years or so 
before World War I, global trade grew rap
idly despite the ever-higher tariff walls 
built by the rising protectionist empires of 
the United States, Germany, Russia, France, and 
Japan. Geopolitical conflicts and trade wars grew 
more common even as markets became more inte
grated. These contradictions were at the heart of 
heated debates over free trade and economic 
nationalism that dominated the industrializing 
world at the time.
 Emerging economic nationalism today eerily 
echoes the first age of globalization—and is an even 
bigger bundle of contradictions. Nationalist forces 
reemerged from the Great Recession of 2008–09 
as a potent political and economic force across the 
globe. And yet ours is a world of extraordinary eco
nomic interdependence wrought from technolog
ical marvels, the likes of which the science fiction 
writer Jules Verne could only dream. 
Between the 1840s and 1860s, trade liberaliza
tion appeared to be the name of the globalization 
game. Britain ushered in the mid-century flirta
tion with free trade, when the island nation’s liber
als successfully overturned the Corn Laws. These 
protective tariffs on foreign grain benefited landed 
aristocrats but forced the working-class poor to pay 
more to feed themselves. Britain’s free-trade advo
cates made a compelling case to the public that get
ting rid of grain tariffs would usher in a new era of 
cheap and plentiful food for the hungry masses 
pouring into its industrial centers. 
But they also made a compelling case that a 
peaceful and prosperous world of economic inter
dependence was possible—if Britain’s imperial 
rivals also liberalized their markets. After all, why 
seize colonies or wage war over raw materials when 
the world’s products could be purchased through 
peaceful market competition? As Richard Cobden, 
Britain’s mid-century “apostle of free trade,” put it, 
trade liberalization would so unite the world that 
militant landed elites could no longer “plunge their 
people into wars.”

 The national system
 Some, like the German-American protectionist the
orist Friedrich List, disagreed. During his US exile, 
List updated Alexander Hamilton’s 18th century 
economic nationalist vision for the rapidly globaliz
ing world of the 1840s. After returning to Germany, 
he published his 1841 magnum opus, The National 
System of Political Economy, in the hope of counter
ing the cosmopolitan call of free trade. 
The British had, he warned, relied on decades of 
protectionism to reach the industrial summit. They 
now sought to “kick away the ladder” so that oth
ers could not challenge their position as “manufac
turer of the world.” List called on Britain’s imperial 
rivals to establish strong nation-states—with high 
tariffs to foster “infant” industries into adulthood 
and colonial expansion to exploit the raw materials 
of Latin America, Asia, and Africa. 
List’s imperial protectionist proposal fell on deaf 
European and American ears at the time. Advocates 
of trade liberalization seemed poised to win the day. 
In 1846, Britain’s liberal free-trade visionaries cel
ebrated the demise of the Corn Laws. Thanks to 
Cobden and his middle-class supporters, Britain 
became the first imperial power to unilaterally 
embrace free trade. Cobden’s non-intervention
ist wing in Parliament also fought unsuccessfully 
against coercive mid-century free-trade policies in 
colonial spaces such as India and China. 
Cobden and his followers next turned their free
trade attention to the US and the European conti
nent. In 1846, the US followed Britain’s lead and 
substantially lowered its tariffs. European trade 
liberalization, however, required more diplo
macy. The 1860 Anglo-French (or Cobden-Che
valier) commercial treaty signaled that Europe’s 
two biggest imperial rivals might be ready to turn 
their swords into ploughshares. The treaty’s inno
vative inclusion of a most-favored-nation clause 
granted other European powers the same low tariff 
treatment if they responded in kind. About 50 or 
60 trade treaties were signed, locking Europe into 
what was effectively its first common market. 
Technological tools
 A more liberal economic order was coming, and 
the technological tools of globalization’s first age 
seemed well placed to tie it all together. Transoce
anic steamship lines drastically lowered transporta
tion costs and travel times. The transatlantic cable, 
successfully laid in 1866, meant that messages 
between Wall Street and the City of London took 
mere minutes. The opening of the Suez Canal in 
Egypt and the completion of the US transcontinen
tal railway in 1869 shrank the world even further. 
These developments sparked the globalist imagi
nation, including Jules Verne’s Around the World in 
Eighty Days (1872).
 But globalization’s unprecedented interdepen
dence soon landed the industrializing world in an 
unpredictable boom-bust economic cycle. Low 
transportation costs, mass industrialization, and 
trade liberalization cut costs for consumers, but the 
steep fall in prices also meant tighter profit margins, 
or even losses, for many of the world’s exporters. 
The British-led gold standard greased the wheels 
of international trade, but its deflationary effects 
spelled doom for many debt-ridden agrarians and 
manufacturers. 
The first age of globalization was facing the first 
Great Depression (1873–96), and protectionism 
and colonialism were the policies of choice of the 
industrializing world. Globalization’s protesters 
grew louder. As is common during economic cri
sis, cries for national self-sufficiency drowned out 
calls for cosmopolitan comity. Free trade fell out of 
fashion among Britain’s imperial rivals, who redis
covered the protectionist ideas of List, catapulting 
him from pariah to prophet. 
Economic conspiracy
 Imperial-minded economic nationalists across the 
globe began to revere List’s national system as eco
nomic divination. Free trade was seen as part of a 
vast British conspiracy to thwart the industrializa
tion projects of rivals—a self-serving trick to under
mine emerging industries elsewhere. List-inspired 
economic nationalists saw geopolitics as a zero
sum game in which only the fittest would survive. 
The technological tools of globalization that 
not so long ago promised to tie the world together 
in benign universalism now seemed better suited 
for binding colonies to imperial metropoles. Tariff 
walls grew ever higher, turning infant industries 
into monopolies, cartels, and trusts. Monopoly-in
duced market inefficiencies at home soon sparked 
an interimperial search for new markets to export 
surplus capital and acquire raw materials. Trade 
wars, military interventions, and the scramble for 
colonies in Africa and Asia picked up pace. 
By 1880, economic nationalists had the upper 
hand. Their imperial protectionist politics moved 
ever more to the right. In the US, the Republican 
Party rebranded itself as the party of protectionism 
and big business, reversing the freer trade trend of 
the preceding decades. The 1890 McKinley Tariff, 
which imposed an unprecedented average rate of 
about 50 percent, plunged the country into trade 
wars with European trading partners. 
But the Benjamin Harrison administration 
encouraged the tariff’s passage with one particular 
imperial acquisition in mind: Canada. It hoped that

 a single-tax colony in the US, a young Georgist rad
ical named Lizzie Magie in 1904 patented a board 
game to teach young and old alike about the evils 
of exploitative land rents—giving birth to what is 
now the world’s most popular board game, Monop
oly. In 1912, the Republic of China’s newly minted 
provisional president, Sun Yat-Sen, stepped down 
from the role to devote himself to promoting the 
“teachings of your single taxer, Henry George,” and 
grow his nation into an “industrious, peace-loving, 
prosperous people.”
 Monopoly capitalism
 Britain’s Edwardian free traders sought to make 
sense of the symbiotic relationship between 
monopolies, protectionism, and imperialism—or 
“monopoly capitalism”—that had come to define 
the British-controlled northern neighbor would seek 
admission to the US rather than pay the exorbitantly 
high tariff. Canada’s Conservative Party instead 
established closer economic ties within the British 
Empire; the newly completed Canadian Pacific Rail
way made Canada a land bridge connecting Britain 
with its far-flung colonies in the Pacific. 
In Germany, Otto von Bismarck, who was 
rumored to keep The National System as bedside 
reading, in Listian fashion consolidated the Ger
man states, erected tariff walls around them, and 
looked abroad for new colonies. His successor, Will
helm II, started construction of the Berlin-to-Bagh
dad railway to better connect them. And in Russia, 
Count Sergei Witte explicitly styled himself after 
List. Whether as director of railway affairs, finance 
minister, or prime minister, Witte remained well 
placed from the early 1890s to start construction 
of the Trans-Siberian railway to facilitate Russia’s 
imperial designs on Manchuria. Similar economic 
nationalist stories played out within the empires of 
France and Japan. 
Marginalized liberal defenders of free trade 
turned to grassroots organizing to stem the mount
ing protectionist imperial tide. In the US, Henry 
George, a San Francisco journalist, wrote Progress 
and Poverty (1879), an international bestseller and 
a road map for breaking up the land monopolies of 
the railway tycoons, aristocrats, and speculators, by 
imposing a tax on the potential value of land. His 
idea became known as Georgism, or the “single 
tax,” because it promised to do away with all other 
forms of taxation, including tariffs. 
The single-tax movement’s promotion of an 
interdependent world of absolute free trade devoid 
of land monopolies found an international welcome. 
Russian writer and pacifist Leo Tolstoy became an 
ardent disciple, believing that the single tax was the 
antidote to the poison of serfdom. While residing in 
the first age of globalization. The Georgist “Land 
Song” was a rip-roaring anthem sung at Liberal 
Party gatherings. 
At the same time, the economist J. A. Hobson 
enunciated one of the most scathing critiques of 
monopoly capitalism and the scramble for colo
nies in Imperialism: A Study (1902). Eight years later, 
Norman Angell, a journalist, became so concerned 
about a looming global conflict that he warned of the 
“great illusion” that any nation could win from war: 
World markets were so interdependent that even the 
so-called winners would lose. The outbreak of World 
War I four years later proved him right.
 The similarities between then and now are hid
ing in plain sight. The quarter century between the 
end of the Corn Laws in 1846 and the start of the 
global turn to protectionism in the early 1870s saw 
unprecedented trade liberalization, as did the 25 
years after the end of the Cold War. And much as 
the 19th century liberal free-trade advocates under
appreciated the political appeal of nationalism and 
economic self-sufficiency, so too were their intel
lectual successors in the late 20th century precipi
tous in predicting the end of the nation-state—and 
even the end of history. 
Because history hasn’t ended, it remains a use
ful guide. Today’s cosmopolitan supporters of eco
nomic interdependence should understand how 
their counterparts more than a century ago fought 
to transform their economic nationalist era of 
globalization into a more peaceful and equitable 
free-trade world. Their longer-term successes are 
a testament to how international cooperation can 
counteract nationalist-driven conflict. F&D

 A Causal Pioneer
 Gary Seidman profiles Stanford economist 
Guido Imbens, who is reshaping how 
researchers establish cause and effect in  
the real world 
there have been a couple of times in Guido Imbens’ life when he has been 
seriously underestimated. Once, as a diligent schoolboy in The Netherlands, young 
Guido was unceremoniously banished for weeks from his first economics class after 
clashing with a teacher over a textbook. Years later, during a faculty interview at Har
vard University, a combative associate professor—who ultimately became Imbens’ 
closest friend and corecipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics—voted against hiring 
him. “He thought the work I was doing in my thesis was boring,” Imbens says. “It 
was very dry and technical,” Joshua Angrist recalls with a chuckle three decades later.
 There are some things in life and in economics that you can’t fully know. Imbens 
shared the 2021 Nobel Prize with Angrist, of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and labor economist David Card, of the University of California, Berkeley, 
for transforming how economists understand cause and effect. Imbens and Angrist 
developed tools to answer life’s What if? questions, not only to explain what actually 
occurred but also to use natural experiments to estimate what would have happened 
if circumstances had been different. Take a basic question: Does going to college really 
cause people to earn more money over their careers? You can’t run a perfect experiment 
by sending the same person down two different life paths—one where they go to

 same time, you can’t send two people 
down different life paths solely for the 
purpose of an experiment; that would 
be unethical. 
So Imbens and his colleagues 
designed and tested sharper tools to 
work with real-world data—messy, 
imperfect, observational data—to esti
mate outcomes that otherwise can’t 
be directly observed. They pioneered 
causal inference, which, for example, 
compares similar people who, by chance 
or circumstance, make different choices. 
For instance, during the Vietnam 
War, a draft lottery randomly assigned 
young men draft numbers. Those hold
ing low numbers were more likely to 
face conscription. Many young men 
could avoid military service by enroll
ing in college. The draft lottery thus 
created a kind of natural experiment, 
allowing researchers to compare out
comes, such as earnings, between simi
lar individuals—some who served in the 
military and some who didn’t—primarily 
because of their randomly assigned draft 
number and its influence on their likeli
hood of being drafted, rather than solely 
on personal motivation. Why does that 
matter? Because correlation isn’t enough. 
If a government wants to expand oppor
tunities and boost incomes, it needs 
to know whether college really causes 
higher earnings—not just that they often 
go together. Today, these methods help 
policymakers, doctors, businesses, and 
researchers make better decisions based 
on real-life evidence.
 Fruitful friendships
 The turning point in Imbens’ career 
came in the early 1990s at Harvard, 
when—despite a rocky start—he struck 
up a collaboration and lasting friendship 
with Angrist. Their partnership took 
shape not in a classroom but in a local 
laundromat. The two were junior faculty 
members who often found themselves 
folding shirts and trading ideas to the 
hum of tumbling clothes dryers on Sat
urday mornings. “It’s more fun to work 
with your friends,” says Angrist. “I tell 
my students that you want to pick your 
collaborators as carefully and thought
fully as you pick your spouse,” he joked 
to NobelPrize.org. That friendship led 
to their most influential contribution, 
the development of the Local Average 
Treatment Effect (LATE) framework. 
It offers a rigorous way to estimate how 
an intervention—like going to college—
 affects people who experience it only 
because of some random circumstance, 
such as winning a scholarship.
 Today, LATE is a standard tool 
for turning messy data into credible 
insights. Imbens describes it as a way 
to focus not on everyone, but specifi
cally on the people whose choices are 
shifted by an outside force—a law, a 
rule, or a change in circumstance. Poli
cymakers, for example, use it to assess 
how the availability—by law—of gov
ernment-paid health insurance at age 
65 impacts health care use and to mea
sure the earnings effect of staying in 
school longer because of compulsory 
education laws. In industry, Silicon 
Valley uses it to evaluate new features 
in tech platforms through randomized 
rollouts. By focusing on the people 
whose behavior is nudged by real-world 
events, LATE has helped move econom
ics from theoretical models to practical, 
evidence-based policy.
 Imbens credits the foundational 
work of statistician Donald Rubin—
 another Harvard colleague and 
friend—with helping shape the way he 
and Angrist thought about causality. 
He says the approach built on earlier 
studies, including Angrist’s collabora
tion with the late Alan Krueger, a pio
neering labor economist. Their 1991 
paper estimates the causal effect of 
education on earnings using people’s 
quarter of birth and US school-entry 
laws. That paper “was very influen
tial” for advancing causal economics, 
Imbens emphasizes. Those early nat
ural experiments laid the groundwork 
for the credibility revolution in eco
nomics in the 1990s, when research
ers began questioning assumptions 
and insisting on plausible comparisons. 
They began asking, What would have 
happened if circumstances had been 
different? It was an empirical shift that 
Imbens helped define with new tools 
and sharper identification strategies. 
Card, who shared the Nobel with 
experiments in labor markets, notes that 
Imbens occupies a rare middle ground 
between theory and practice. “I’m more 
of a practitioner. He’s more of a meth
odology guy. But he’s among the meth
odology people who are most interested 
in what applied people are doing,” Card 
says. Together, their work helps bridge 
the gap between what is happening 
in the world and how we can reliably 
understand why it’s happening. Imbens 
says, “We wanted to make econometrics 
useful for empirical people in a way that 
we thought wasn’t quite there yet.”
 But what Imbens brings to a team is 
far more than just intellectual firepower, 
says Rubin. “He’s just innately friendly.” 
He has a calm presence and collegial
ity that defuses tension and brings the 
focus back to the work, Rubin says. “He 
has a different sort of approach to life in 
many ways.” 
Curious beginnings
 Imbens was born in 1963 in Geldrop, 
in the southern Netherlands. Though 
his parents were not academics them
selves—and not university graduates 
when Imbens was young—they nur
tured intellectual exploration. “They 
stimulated that in us,” Imbens says. His 
father gave him and his two siblings 
math problems to solve for fun. “We 
enjoyed doing them,” Imbens remem
bers. It sparked his curiosity and love of 
logical thinking, skills that would shape 
his approach to economics years later. 
“So both my siblings and I ended up 
going to university. In fact, my brother 
got a PhD in mathematics.”
 As a boy, Imbens was captivated 
by chess, a passion that reflected his 
love of strategy and analytical thought. 
He also inherited a streak of indepen
dence—and a touch of stubbornness—
 from his mother, Annie Imbens-Fran
sen, who later in life became a feminist 
theologian and an author. He remem
bers his mother’s instinct for noncon
formity. “We were living in housing 
that was owned by Philips,” the multi
national Dutch electronics firm where 
his father worked. “Once a year they 
[Philips] would paint the front doors this 
vile bright yellow,” Imbens recalls. “My

 after they painted the doors yellow, we

F&D
 and machine learning. “Susan is a very 
broad economist… She’s always a source 
of townhouses. There was one house 
with a non-yellow door.”
 After high school, Imbens chose to 
attend Erasmus University Rotterdam, 
where one of his early influences, fellow 
Dutch economist and Nobel Prize–win
ner Jan Tinbergen, had established an 
econometrics program. He then went 
on to earn a master’s in 1986 at the 
University of Hull in the UK, under the 
mentorship of Anthony Lancaster, who 
ultimately persuaded Imbens to follow 
him to Brown University, where Imbens 
received his PhD in 1991. “Getting into 
Brown for his PhD felt like winning the 
lottery for Guido,” says Susan Athey, 
Imbens’ wife and a fellow economics 
professor at Stanford University.
 Lancaster introduced Imbens to 
Bayesian econometrics and provided 
the intellectual tools and, perhaps more 
important, the network of connections 
that helped launch Imbens’ academic 
career in the United States.
 After a stint at Harvard, Imbens held 
faculty positions at the University of 
California, Los Angeles, and Berkeley, 
and ultimately Stanford, where he now 
teaches. A landmark use of causal infer
ence occurred when Imbens was at UCLA, 
in a study with Rubin and Harvard PhD 
student Bruce Sacerdote. They used lot
tery data to examine how sudden finan
cial windfalls affect people’s work and 
spending decisions. The results—show
ing that people don’t necessarily quit 
their jobs after a windfall but that many 
of inspiration for the type of problems I 
around basic income and pensions while 
also broadening the reach of causal infer
ence beyond education and health.
 Solving problems
 Imbens is quick to acknowledge the role 
of serendipity in his own life. “I do feel 
very fortunate. I’ve just been incredibly 
lucky to be in the right place at the right 
time.” Still, he believes strongly that 
cultivating meaningful relationships 
with many of the leading economists of 
his generation is as critical to his work 
as technical skill, and he places great 
importance on his role today of men
toring younger scholars. “I’m trying to 
influence the profession more generally 
in a direction that makes sense—where 
econometricians are working on prob
lems that are important for empirical 
work,” he says. “I try to instill that in my 
students: It’s not always about the math
ematics—it’s about interesting problems.”
 In March 2025, Imbens was named 
faculty director of Stanford Data Sci
ence, an initiative that supports research 
and scholarship through data-driven 
discovery and data science education 
across the campus. He sees the role as 
a chance to encourage young research
ers, deepen interdisciplinary ties, and 
bring data science into closer conversa
tion with real-world policy. 
Economic collaboration is never far 
from home. Imbens’ wife, Athey, is a 
John Bates Clark Medal winner who is 
known for her pioneering work at the 
intersection of technology, economics, 
work on,” Imbens says. “We’ve really 
shared the load all the way through—and 
shared the fun,” Athey says, noting that 
despite his heavy workload, Imbens leads 
a very grounded life, biking with col
leagues on weekends, tending to his gar
den, having his students over for events, 
and when time allows, which is rare these 
days, preparing memorable meals. 
But his most notable achievement is 
helping to reshape the way economists 
think about evidence, policy, and uncer
tainty. In doing so, he has brought clar
ity to questions that had once seemed 
unanswerable and opened the door for 
more credible social science. In a field 
that often rewards certainty, Imbens 
has made a career out of working in 
the messy middle—a place where data 
are imperfect and intellectual honesty 
matters most. That, too, is a form of ele
gance. When the Nobel Prize Museum 
asked each laureate to donate an item 
that was meaningful to their research, 
Imbens chose a container of laundry 
detergent—a quiet tribute to those 
early mornings spent folding shirts 
and trading ideas with Angrist. Few 
tokens could better capture the spirit of 
his work—rigorous, collaborative, and 
f
 irmly grounded in the real world. F&D

 Taxing Matters
 Stefanie Stantcheva explains how 
policymakers can raise taxes without scaring 
off innovators
 The Internal Revenue Service building in Washington, 
DC, has its raison d’être etched in stone across its 
facade: “Taxes are what we pay for civilized soci
ety.” That quote is from Oliver Wendell Holmes 
Jr., a Supreme Court justice in the early 1900s, but some 
prominent modern-day Americans, such as Steve Jobs, 
argue that it is innovation that truly allows societies to 
evolve: “Innovation distinguishes between a leader and 
a follower,” Jobs said. So what happens when those two 
things work against each other...when taxes start to weigh 
on innovation?
 Stefanie Stantcheva wants to know how tax policy can 
make or break the innovative spirit, a subject she studies 
at Harvard University’s Social Economics Lab, which she 
founded. Her fascination with economics began when she 
was a young girl growing up in Bulgaria 
in the 1990s amid bouts of hyperinfla
tion. She later moved to France and East 
Germany, where she found more eco
nomic puzzles to solve. Stantcheva was 
destined to become an economist and 
has been doing remarkable research 
ever since.
 Her work on taxation and innova
tion won her the 2025 John Bates Clark 
Medal—known as the Baby Nobel—
 awarded for the most significant contri
butions to economic thought and knowl
edge by an economist under age 40. 
Stantcheva’s youthful approach has 
shed light on trends such as zero-sum 
thinking, which challenges conven
tional wisdom on growth and, she says, 
helps explain the reasoning behind the 
perception of economic policies among 
younger generations.

Innovators and inventors are economic 
agents, like everyone else, and they care 
about economic incentives and rewards. 
Our studies show the effect of taxation 
on inventors in the United States all the 
way back to the 1930s. We wanted to

 F&D
 I must get a smaller slice. It contrasts 
with positive-sum thinking—the belief 
ents, and the location. States with higher 
personal—and especially higher corpo
rate income taxes—lost out to lower-in
come-tax states in terms of innovation.
 F&D: So if a state wants more innova
tion, more start-ups, all it has to do is 
lower taxes?
 SS: It’s more complicated, because tax
ation exists for a good reason. We need 
to raise revenue to finance important 
public spending. If a state has a lot of 
amenities—measured, for instance, by 
the number of inventors located there 
already, or by its research infrastruc
ture—this dampens the effects of higher 
taxes. California, for example, has rel
atively high taxes. Yet innovators still 
want to move there because there is 
so much innovation there already and 
because of the many amenities, which 
are partly financed by high taxes. And 
this is also true in other major patent
ing countries, in western Europe and 
Canada, for instance. Superstar inven
tors are highly mobile and sensitive to 
taxes. Migration effects are powerful for 
highly qualified inventors. 
The policy conclusion is that because 
taxes are needed for lots of reasons, it’s 
important to dampen their negative 
economic effects. The way revenues 
are spent is critical. Revenues that foster 
research and innovation infrastructure, 
that make a location attractive, allow a 
state or a country to sustain higher taxes 
without losing all innovative capacity.
 F&D: Taxation is a recurring theme 
in your research. What makes it so 
interesting?
 SS: Who likes taxes, right? But they 
affect so many aspects of our lives. A 
well-designed tax system can encour
age growth and equality and provide 
great infrastructure and public ser
vices. But a poorly designed tax system 
can have terrible cascading effects that 
hamper economic development. Tax
ation is such a powerful tool that it’s 
important to study it and get it right.
 F&D: One thing that sets your research 
apart is the way you use surveys, which 
SS: Surveys have been around for a 
very long time in economics, but there 
are things that remain completely 
invisible in data, no matter how good

is why the surveys we do at the Social 
Economics Lab are so important. We 
try to understand how people think 
about economic issues and economic 
policies. We go deep into how people 
reason, why they reason the way they 
do, why they hold some views and 
not others. Our surveys also typically 
incorporate something experimen
tal, which means some people will 
see one type of information while oth
ers will see another. We can see what 
happens from that additional informa
tion or that different angle on an issue. 
We’re creating big data on something 
unusual: what’s happening in people’s 
minds. We can analyze it in a quanti
tative way. We can see patterns and 
understand cause and effect. We can 
draw many lessons from this. 
F&D: Can you give an example?
 SS: We tried to see how people in 20 
countries feel about major climate 
policies. An interesting example is the 
trade-off between taxing pollution and 
banning it altogether. Should we tax pol
luting cars and still let people purchase 
them if they’re willing to pay the price? 
Or should we ban polluting cars alto
gether? Economic theory suggests that 
a tax is more efficient than an outright 
ban. But people feel differently, and our 
surveys help us understand why. And it 
turns out people are driven by a strong 
equity concern. People find it unfair that 
the rich can simply pay to pollute while 
others cannot. They consider an out
right ban to be fairer.
 F&D: And your other study suggests 
more people are thinking in zero-sum 
terms. What’s that about?
 SS: Zero-sum thinking is the belief 
that if one individual or group gains, it 
must come at the expense of another. 
It’s the belief in a limited amount of 
good. If you get a larger slice of the pie, 
that we can grow the pie and don’t 
need to be in direct competition with 
each other. We set out to study how 
this mindset is spread across the US—
 across different groups, different gen
erations, different places—and where 
it comes from and how it shapes pol
icy views. Zero-sum thinking, it turns 
out, is much more prevalent among 
younger people in the US. That might 
seem surprising, but it’s also true in 
other rich countries. The economic 
environment really matters. People 
who grew up in a time of lower growth 
and lower mobility, as is the case for 
younger generations in the US, are 
much more likely to be zero-sum.
 The pattern is flipped in emerg
ing market economies, where there is 
higher growth and higher mobility than 
before. Younger generations in these 
countries are less zero-sum than the 
older ones. But the economic environ
ment also matters at the individual level. 
So if your own family has experienced 
upward mobility, then you are less likely 
to be zero-sum.
 F&D: Do you see this further politiciz
ing economic policy debates?
 SS: What’s interesting about zero-sum 
thinking is that, unlike so many other 
things today, it’s not a partisan issue: 
It’s evenly distributed across both sides 
of the political divide. It’s not the case 
that one political group is more zero
sum than the other. It does, however, 
explain a lot of within-party variation in 
policy views. People who are more zero
sum, for instance, want more govern
ment intervention to protect the group 
that’s suffering from the zero-sum sit
uation. People who are more zero-sum 
support more redistribution, driven by 
the idea that the gains of the rich come 
at the expense of the poor. It’s interest
ing to think about this in light of younger 
generations today being more zero-sum. 
What might this mean for policies in the 
future? F&D

 FALSE DAWN: The 
New Deal and 
the Promise 
of Recovery, 
1933–1947
 George Selgin
 University of 
Chicago Press
 Chicago,IL,  
2025, 384 pp., $35  
us president Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal projects 
and regulations were so wide-ranging in their aims and scope 
that it’s hard to reach a simple verdict on their effectiveness. 
George Selgin rightly avoids attempting to do so in False Dawn, 
his new book examining the administration’s 1933–39 policies 
and the recovery from the Great Depression.  
Selgin, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute’s Center for Mon
etary and Financial Alternatives and economics professor emer
itus at the University of Georgia, challenges the idea that the 
New Deal was a coherent plan that Roosevelt designed before 
taking office. Rather, key components were cobbled together 
after his inauguration, often without Roosevelt’s initial support. 
Selgin takes on these components one by one, from the 
1933 bank holiday and the gold programs to the alphabet soup 
of agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor
poration (FDIC), the Reconstruction Finance Corporation 
(RFC), the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), 
the National Recovery Administration (NRA), and the Home 
Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC). 
In these chapters, Selgin describes the conventional wis
dom about some aspects of the New Deal, the challenges to 
the conventional wisdom, and the challenges to the challenges. 
He evaluates the literature and his own read of the historical 
record. By the end of each chapter, we know exactly where he 
stands, how firmly, and on what strength of evidence. 
Selgin pinpoints where evidence is shaky or missing, mak
ing the book a treasure trove of research ideas for economic 
historians. For example, he also points to a need for improved 
empirical studies estimating the effects of policy uncertainty 
on investment—an especially important topic today, with some 
measures of economic policy uncertainty at record highs. 
For a more general audience, the book’s most important 
contribution is its debunking of what Selgin calls the “Keynes
ian myth,” or “popular tendency to identify the New Deal with 
Keynesian economics,” which has “had an unfortunate effect 
on discourses concerning the merits of each.” Selgin cites Eric 
Rauchway’s 2015 book The Money Makers as Keynesian myth
making, specifically its assertion that Roosevelt “conducted 
an active monetary and fiscal program of 
recovery…working along lines suggested 
by Keynes.” Selgin shows that Roosevelt 
was not influenced by Keynes. He was 
firmly committed to fiscal conservatism 
until after 1937, and the Federal Reserve 
did not deliberately use monetary stimu
lus in response to the Depression.
 Perhaps even more important than 
the decidedly un-Keynesian mone
tary and fiscal policy was Roosevelt’s 
disregard for Keynes’s warnings about 
expectations. Keynes recognized that 
Roosevelt’s antibusiness attitude and 
various New Deal policies, especially 
the National Industrial Recovery Act, 
were breeding fear and uncertainty and 
precluded the possibility of an invest
ment-led recovery. 
Business leaders shared Keynes’s 
sense that the policy uncertainty gener
ated by the New Deal was highly coun
terproductive. Selgin quotes Lammot du 
Pont II, president of the chemical com
pany Dupont, who remarked in 1937 that 
“uncertainty rules the tax situation, the 
labor situation, the monetary situation 
and practically every legal condition 
under which industry must operate…The 
whole future is a gigantic question mark.” 
Selgin explains that “it isn’t simply bad 
outcomes that frighten investors; it’s also 
not knowing what’s in store.” F&D

 “Trade during wartime 
was once considered a 
nonstarter because it was 
seen as contributing to 
military capability.”
 in trade in war, Mariya Grinberg probes a fundamen
tal question: Why do warring countries trade with each other? 
Grinberg, a political science professor at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, posits both economic and security 
imperatives. In short, countries allow as much wartime trade 
as makes military sense and prohibit as much militarily dan
gerous trade as is economically viable. A series of case stud
ies follow—spanning the Crimean War, both world wars, and 
the post–Cold War era—during which wartime trade “should 
have been least likely.”
 It may seem evident that warring countries can maintain 
some kind of commercial relationship, but Grinberg reminds 
us that this was not always true. A striking section of the book 
examines the introduction of “neutral rights” during the 
Crimean War, which caused a fundamental shift in thinking 
about trade during war: Nuanced trade policy can replace the 
extreme practice of severing all trade.
 Trade during wartime was once considered a nonstarter 
because it was seen as contributing to military capability. 
Grinberg explains that after the onset of the Crimean War, 
and by complete happenstance, a large amount of produce 
already paid for by France got stuck in Russian ports because of 
late-melting ice in the Baltic Sea. These circumstances opened 
the way for France to persuade Britain and Russia to allow the 
shipment through despite the ongoing war. This led to a dec
laration on the rights of neutrals and eventual adoption of the 
Declaration of Paris, which codified such practices through 
subsequent conflicts, allowing trade to continue and, more 
important, shifting perceptions of the acceptability of trade 
during conflict.
 Building on this historical foundation of neutral rights, 
Grinberg demonstrates how states developed more sophis
ticated frameworks for wartime trade decisions. She empha
sizes the importance of the “conversion time” of trade prod
ucts into military capability and the revenue generated by 
these trades. This helps determine wartime commercial 
decisions by weighing immediate military benefits against 
long-term economic costs. The case study of World War I

 shows how Britain and Germany fre
quently adjusted their commercial 
policies as the war progressed and 
their expectations about the conflict’s 
duration and stakes changed. Britain’s 
initial lax policy, based on the antici
pation of a short war, tightened as the 
war dragged on. Germany, in contrast, 
went on to make more dire predictions 
about the stakes of the war and imple
mented an even more prohibitive pol
icy, but ultimately allowed for more 
trade once it became clear the conflict 
would be protracted.
 The book ends with a look at more 
modern conflicts and whether states 
resolve the trade-off between eco
nomic and security imperatives in the 
same way without the pressures of war. 
Strategic calculations are complicated 
in today’s global economy, she argues, 
particularly given global value chains 
and economic interdependence of 
major trading partners. Yet, according 
to Grinberg’s understanding of wartime 
trade, this also suggests that decoupling 
in these circumstances is highly unlikely 
even amid heightened tension. This 
should come as no surprise given a key 
through line of the book: Economic 
cooperation can thrive even in the most 
hostile times. F&D

 History’s Earliest 
Hustlers
 Nicholas Owen
 “the history of rome,” writes US archaeologist Kim 
Bowes, “is peopled by the rich.” Cicero, Livy, and Tacitus 
chronicled the lives of consuls and emperors, but the classical 
world’s most celebrated scholars weren’t interested in ordinary 
working Romans. It’s an omission Bowes seeks to remedy in 
her remarkable and meticulously researched new book, Sur
viving Rome: The Economic Lives of the Ninety Percent.
 We meet a colorful cast of characters who survived—and 
sometimes even thrived—in what the author describes as 
the world’s first “global” economy. The challenges faced by 
ancient Egypt’s Soterichos family, who turned to cash crops to 
pay off debt, shed light on smallholder agriculture. We learn 
how Romans accessed credit in times of want from stories of 
the Pompeian pawnbroker and moneylender Faustilla. And the 
dealings of army supplier Philokles, who pimped out prostitutes 
to a garrison at Krokodilo in Egypt’s Eastern Desert, form part of 
a discussion of income earned by working for the Roman state. 
Bowes, a professor of classical studies at the University of 
Pennsylvania and former director of the American Academy 
in Rome, rejects the notion that all premodern societies were 
essentially the same—that it’s possible to fill gaps in our knowl
edge of the ancient world by retrojecting based on peoples and 
places we know better. She draws instead on archaeological 
discoveries, bookkeeping records, and even human skeletons 
from far corners of the empire. The economy that emerges 
from these sources—many of which have surfaced or been sub
ject to rigorous scientific analysis only in the past 20 years—is 
far more complex than hitherto supposed.
 At the heart of this economy was a paradox: high con
sumption and rapidly expanding demand for cheap consumer 
goods—from greater varieties of food and drink to highly stan
dardized pots, jugs, and jewelry—combined with low income 
and limited opportunities to earn a wage. Romans dealt with 
this income gap and supported themselves during months of 
scarcity through credit, pawning possessions, or borrowing 
against the next harvest or another source of future income. 
Social mobility depended on accumulating small amounts 
of capital that could generate additional income—a plot of 
“Bowes does not shy away 
from comparisons with 
the precarious economic 
existence of many people 
today.”

 farmland, a yoke of oxen, a pottery kiln, 
or a loom for weaving. Yet most families 
struggled to amass savings to transform 
into capital.
 Neat analytical categories such as 
farmer, artisan, or wage laborer fall 
apart on contact with the messy real
ity of ordinary Romans who depended 
on a multitude of income sources to 
make ends meet. Distinctions between 
adult and child, rural and urban, cred
itor and debtor—even between free 
and enslaved—become blurred when it 
comes to ordinary lives.
 Bowes does not shy away from 
comparisons with the precarious eco
nomic existence of many people today. 
The relentless persistence of working 
Romans who “squeezed a living out 
of their circumstances” through graft, 
hustles, and money maneuvers is not 
so different from the efforts of a wide 
swath of 21st century American society, 
Bowes writes. Discussions of modern 
economic thinkers, from Adam Smith 
and Karl Marx to John Kenneth Gal
braith and Thomas Piketty, add con
temporary resonance.
 Bowes’s lively storytelling, accom
panied by dozens of illustrations and 
photographs, will interest specialist 
and general readers alike. “It’s amaz
ing,” Bowes writes, “how much we can 
know about the 90 percent just by lis
tening to them.” F&D

 Currency Notes
 Tradition and Technology

 Bermuda’s new notes honor history with more 
durable, accessible, and sustainable design
 bermuda’s first coins, minted around 1616, were 
“hogge money.” They featured a galleon on one side and a hog 
on the other, a nod to free-roaming swine descended from those 
abandoned by Spanish and Portuguese mariners—and which, 
a century later, were a source of sustenance for shipwrecked 
English sailors. The poor-quality money, however, was aban
doned after a few years when tobacco became the local currency. 
Today, modern money in the British overseas territory 
continues to highlight the Atlantic archipelago’s unique flora, 
fauna, and landscape. These themes, consistent across issu
ance since the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) was cre
ated in 1969, make its notes and coins prized by collectors and 
praised for their design.
 The BMA introduced its new $2 and $5 banknotes last year—
 the lowest denominations of the Bermuda dollar. The currency 
has been pegged to the US dollar since 1972, and both circulate 
interchangeably. The updates, which largely keep the origi
nal appearance, will be followed by changes for $10, $20, $50, 
and $100 bills. 
Bermuda’s pink $5 bill won the Banknote of the Year award 
from the International Bank Note Society, which cited its high
tech security measures and “colorful, eye-pleasing design.” 
The industry group High Security Printing Latin America 
named the $2 and $5 best new 2025 notes.
 The $5 notes show a blue marlin, Horseshoe Bay Beach, 
and Somerset Bridge—a short early 1600s span known as the 
world’s smallest drawbridge. Its wood plank, less than a meter 
wide, can be raised to let the masts of sailboats pass through. 
The $2 bill shows a Bermuda bluebird and two historical 
icons of the territory’s role as a Royal Navy base for centu
ries: the Dockyard clock tower and the statue of Neptune. Both 
notes show the new head of state, King Charles III, in his first 
appearance on the currency. 
The notes also share important design elements the mon
etary authority calls a significant step toward greater durabil
ity and security. They are Bermuda’s first printed on polymer 
substrate, a thin plastic that’s easier to keep clean than cotton 
and is expected to circulate more than twice as long. In addition, 
visually impaired users can identify the notes by their embossed
