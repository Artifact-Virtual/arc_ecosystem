Financial stability implications of tokenisation – Executive 
Summary 
Tokenisation refers to the use of new technologies, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), to issue 
or represent assets in digital form as tokens. These tokens can represent traditional financial assets, such 
as securities and bank deposits; physical assets like real estate; or new assets representing claims against 
the issuer.  
Tokenisation is currently small in scale but growing, with potential benefits including improved 
efficiency, reduced costs, increased transparency and broader investor access through asset 
fractionalisation. However, many of these benefits are unproven and may involve trade-offs, such as 
increased operational complexity, liquidity pressures and regulatory uncertainty. 
Against this background, in October 2024, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published the report 
The Financial Stability Implications of Tokenisation to examine current developments in tokenisation, assess 
associated financial stability vulnerabilities and identify policy issues for consideration. 
The report focuses on DLT-based tokenisation, as this is the technology underpinning most 
private and public sector tokenisation projects to date. In particular, it focuses on DLT-based tokenisation 
of financial assets, excluding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and cryptoassets, which are covered 
in separate reports by the FSB and other global standard-setting bodies. 
DLT-based tokenisation – current landscape and key features relevant for 
financial stability 
Tokenisation of financial assets using DLT is still at an early stage. Projects are often small-scale and 
experimental. Notable examples include tokenised bonds issued by the European Investment Bank and 
JPMorgan’s JPM Coin for wholesale payments. Broader adoption is constrained by limited investor 
demand, lack of interoperability between DLT platforms and legacy systems, and regulatory and legal 
uncertainty. 
Key features of tokenisation relevant for financial stability include the following: 
• Governance: Most projects use permissioned DLT platforms with centralised control, though 
some use permissionless systems with less transparency. In general, design choices for DLT 
platforms and the resulting degree of access control may affect issues such as platforms’ 
operational capacity, security and risk management, which have implications for financial stability. 
• Programmability and composability: Smart contracts enable automated execution of 
transactions (programmability), as well as the creation of products that combine features and 
functionalities in new ways (composability). Programmability is relevant for financial stability 
because it can potentially change how financial markets function. Composability, on the other 
hand, may create opaque interdependencies that could affect financial stability. 
• Types of issuance: A token that is linked to a reference asset could result in misalignment of the 
price of the token and the value of the reference asset. In addition, the type of reference asset 
could also result in different risks, including in relation to their storage and valuation. Tokens that 
are not linked to a reference asset are still subject to issuer risks.

• Choice of settlement assets: Tokenisation may use stablecoins, tokenised bank deposits or 
central bank money as settlement assets, each presenting different risk profiles and financial 
stability implications. 
• Third-party reliance: Tokenisation often depends on external service providers, eg as 
“custodians” to safekeep reference assets, as “oracles” to collect and store data on DLT platforms, 
and developers and maintainers of protocols (or “bridges”) that allow the exchange of tokens on 
one DLT platform with tokens on another. These third-party service providers may affect platform 
functioning and token valuation, which can introduce new points of financial system vulnerability. 
Financial stability vulnerabilities associated with tokenisation 
The FSB identifies five key categories of financial stability vulnerabilities associated with DLT-based 
tokenisation, many of which mirror those in traditional finance but may be amplified by new technology 
and governance arrangements: 
Liquidity and maturity mismatch: Differences between token and reference asset 
characteristics may lead to run risks and redemption pressures, especially if tokens are 
perceived as more liquid than the underlying asset. 
Leverage: Composability may facilitate rehypothecation of tokens – or using tokens 
received as collateral for further borrowing – which increases leverage, especially in the 
absence of regulatory limits. 
Asset price and quality risks: Opaqueness in smart contracts and reliance on 
unregulated oracles could impair price discovery and asset valuation. Discrepancies 
between token and reference asset prices may emerge due to legal or market frictions. 
Interconnectedness: Tokenisation platforms could become critical infrastructure linking 
multiple institutions and activities, introducing new contagion pathways. Global, 24/7 
operability may exacerbate volatility and complicate oversight. 
Operational fragilities: Vulnerabilities arise from smart contract errors, private key 
mismanagement, lack of governance standards and the immutability of DLT 
transactions. Permissionless networks may further lack accountability and resilience. 
Conclusions and policy considerations 
Tokenisation currently poses minimal financial stability risks owing to its small scale, focus on permissioned 
platforms, limited programmability and low interconnectedness. However, risks could materialise under 
certain conditions: 
• Significant scaling: Wider adoption, driven by regulatory clarity and interoperability 
improvements, could amplify vulnerabilities. 
• Increased complexity and opacity: Programmability and composability may lead to unintended 
systemic interconnections. 
• Insufficient oversight: If emerging risks are not addressed through appropriate regulation and 
supervision, tokenisation could undermine market integrity and resilience.

should: 
As an initial response, the FSB suggests that standard-setting bodies and national authorities 
• address data gaps by improving monitoring and information collection on tokenisation initiatives 
• consider ways to increase understanding of how tokenisation fits into legal and regulatory 
frameworks and supervisory approaches 
• enhance cross-border regulatory and supervisory information-sharing, particularly given the 
global nature of many tokenisation initiatives
