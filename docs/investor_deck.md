## Slide 2: What is ARCx?

* **ARCx** is the **genesis token** for The Arc Protocol.
* **Enterprise Security**: Zero vulnerabilities across 574 dependencies.
* **Production Ready**: Modern Hardhat toolbox, Ethers v6, comprehensive testing.
* Designed to **bootstrap core infrastructure** with maximum security assurance.
* Immutable, auditable, and future-compatible with the FUEL economy.

## Slide 3: Problem We Solve

❌ Decentralized systems lack ethical, constitutional scaffolding.
❌ Foundational development is underfunded and over-speculated.
❌ Governance capture and inflation ruin long-term trust.
❌ Security vulnerabilities compromise project integrity.

✅ ARCx funds the infrastructure without introducing long-term distortion.
✅ One-time issuance. Zero inflation. Absolute clarity.
✅ **Zero-vulnerability environment** ensures maximum security.
✅ **A+ Security Rating** with comprehensive dependency management.

## Slide 4: The Arc Ecosystem

**ARCx → The Arc → ADAM Protocol → FUEL**

* ARCx funds the L1 deployment.
* The Arc powers constitutional intelligence.
* ADAM governs ethically adaptive rules.
* FUEL becomes the universal substrate of digital civilization.
