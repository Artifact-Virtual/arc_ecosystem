# System Report

> System Status, Threat Model & Security Posture (2025-09-08)

This report provides an end-to-end snapshot of ARCâ€™s security posture, operational state, compliance, and roadmap. It favors deterministic builds, least privilege, and auditable change control.

## On-chain status (Base mainnet)

- Token (ARCx V2 Enhanced): 0xDb3C3f9ECb93f3532b4FD5B050245dd2F2Eec437
- Vesting contract: 0x0bBf1fFda16C2d9833a972b0E9dE535Cf398B600
- Treasury Safe: 0x8F8fdBFa1AF9f53973a7003CbF26D854De9b2f38
- Ecosystem Safe: 0x2ebCb38562051b02dae9cAca5ed8Ddb353d225eb
- Smart Airdrop: 0x40fe447cf4B2af7aa41694a568d84F1065620298

Holders snapshot (from transfer ledger reconstruction):

- Vesting holds ~299,850 ARCX2
- Airdrop holds ~99,950 ARCX2
- Remainder sits with EOAs/LPs; total reconciles to 1,000,000 ARCX2

## Recent operational changes

- LP creation previously unblocked via operational mitigations (temporary fee-exempt allowlist and toggle during LP init; no redeploys). These temporary changes have now been reverted: burn restored to default (0.05%) and Uniswap actors are no longer fee-exempt.
- Token-list and canonical SVG logo finalized (stable raw URLs)
- Vesting batch updated: Core Dev beneficiary to 0x2b446CcB4c758c01C7D04a16E43758551F629102; Treasury schedule to Treasury Safe

## CI/CD integrity and improvements

- Node 18; npm cache enabled. Install strategy: use npm ci when lockfile is present; otherwise fallback to npm install (no forced lockfile creation)
- Security gate: npm audit enforced (fail on high/critical). Coverage and test artifacts uploaded. Slither runs in Docker
- test-results/ directory created pre-run to ensure artifact steps succeed

## Security posture (design and ops)

- Least privilege. Explicit allowlists for fee-exempt roles. Admin ops only via Gnosis Safe, with batch JSON committed pre-execution
- Transfer hooks guarded by checks-effects-interactions; no external calls before state updates
- Vesting approvals bounded; beneficiaries explicit; penalty/governance flags constrained
- No silent changes: all config moves through reviewed PRs and on-chain multisig

## Threat model and mitigations

- Reentrancy: protected by function ordering and nonReentrant patterns where needed
- Gas estimation/DoS via fees: mitigated by whitelisting LP actors and using operational toggles during bootstrap
- Allowance races: approvals minimized/bounded; consider permit where practical
- Upgrades/governance: any upgrade path (if used) goes through timelocked governance and Safe execution

## Findings and gaps (actionable)

- Tests: local runs show 0 passing tests. Reinstate explicit assertions and suites for ERC20 invariants, exemptions, LP init, vesting release/penalties, and airdrop claims
- Invariants: add invariant tests for supply conservation, sum(vesting) â‰¤ approvals, and no unintended transfer restrictions
- Monitoring: add on-chain alerting for admin ops, parameter flips, and abnormal transfer patterns
- Formal checks: run symbolic execution and differential testing for token and vesting flows

## Compliance and regulatory considerations

- Governance/treasury controls: document signer policies; apply KYC/AML where jurisdictionally required
- Disclosures: clear public risk statements; avoid promotional mischaracterizations
- Data protection: if off-chain eligibility is stored, align with GDPR/CCPA
- Sanctions: integrate OFAC/EU lists at distribution edges where applicable
- Accounting/tax: keep audit trails for vesting and distributions
- Frameworks to track (non-exhaustive): EU MiCA (ART/EMT applicability), eIDAS (signing), DORA (ops resilience), US FinCEN MSB guidance, SEC/CFTC posture, FATF travel rule

## Roadmap (next 12â€“24 months)

1. Restore and enforce CI tests (unit, fuzz, invariant) with thresholds
2. Add monitoring/alerts and anomaly detection for transfers and admin ops
3. Formal verification tracks for token/vesting
4. Governance hardening with timelocks and emergency pausability runbooks
5. Integration audits for hooks/partners pre-listing or incentives

## Long-term outlook (5â€“10 years) and how to get there

- Stability through conservative token mechanics and transparent governance
- Security as process: continuous verification, external audits, provable invariants
- Compliance modularity at distribution edges; adaptable policy modules as regulations evolve
- Trust via reproducible builds and transparent Safe transactions

Execution steps:

- Quarter 1â€“2: re-enable tests, add invariants/fuzz, wire monitoring, first formal checks
- Quarter 3â€“4: governance hardening, partner audits, publish security whitepaper/addenda
- Year 2+: periodic external audits, continuous assurance pipeline, expansion with strict change control
