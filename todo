💡 RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
========================

🚀 IMMEDIATE MIGRATION (Recommended):
   ✅ Zero to low current activity detected
   ✅ Clean break from problematic V1 contract
   ✅ Prevents further tokens being stuck
   ✅ Simplified ecosystem state

📋 MIGRATION PHASES:
   Phase 1 (Week 1): Deploy ARCx V2, update core contracts
   Phase 2 (Week 2): Migrate liquidity, update treasury
   Phase 3 (Week 3): Complete testing, external notifications

⚡ MIGRATION EXECUTION ORDER:
   1. Deploy ARCx V2 with proper safeguards
   2. Deploy new vesting contract with V2
   3. Deploy new airdrop contract with V2
   4. Create new Uniswap V4 pool (ARCx V2/WETH)
   5. Migrate liquidity (remove from V1, add to V2)
   6. Update treasury holdings
   7. Complete auction with V1 or migrate to V2
   8. Update all scripts and documentation
   9. Test all integrations
   10. Announce V1 deprecation, V2 launch

💰 COST ANALYSIS:
   Contract deployments: ~$50-100 (Base L2 gas)
   Liquidity migration: ~$20-50 (pool operations)
   Testing and verification: ~$10-20
   Total estimated cost: $80-170 USD

⚠️  RISKS TO CONSIDER:
   • Liquidity fragmentation during transition
   • User confusion about V1 vs V2
   • Smart contract audit requirements for V2
   • Frontend updates needed simultaneously
   • Third-party integration delays

🔒 RISK MITIGATION:
   • Comprehensive testing suite for V2
   • Clear communication about migration
   • Phased rollout with monitoring
   • Emergency pause mechanisms in V2
   • Keep V1 active for 30 days post-migration
