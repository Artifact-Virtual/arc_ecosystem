# Deep Audit Report

============================================================================

> Date: 30-08-2025 ---------- version 0.2.0

**Scope:** Focuses on contracts, scripts, integrations, governance, security, tests, and remediation priorities. Excludes environment variable management and secrets handling.

---

## Executive Summary

This report serves as the follow-up audit to version 0.1.0, reflecting the results of the focused re-audit after CI passes. The immediate actions and recommendations from the previous audit have been addressed, and further enhancements have been identified.

### Top Immediate Actions:
- Validate implementation of static analysis and fuzzing tools.
- Confirm expansion of tests across governance, timelock, bridge, and ADAM modules.
- Ensure verification of third-party contract sources and addresses.
- Reassess multisig enforcement for upgrade/admin roles.

### Scope & Counts

Contracts inspected: ~54 contract files across modules (DAO/governance, tokens, DeFi, vaults, RWA, pool adapters, third-party interfaces).

Major modules:
- Governance: ARCGovernor, ARCTimelock, ARCProposal, ARCVoting, ARCTreasury, ARCDAO
- Policy host: AdamHost, AdamRegistry
- Tokens/identity: ARCx, ARCs, Identity SBTs
- DeFi/infra: Auctions, StakingVaults, TreasuryRewards, PenaltyVault, Bridge, RWARegistry/Slashing
- Pools & third-party adapters: Uniswap v4 interfaces & adapters
- Scripts & tooling: deployment scripts, shared constants, health checks, inspect-tx
- Tests: expanded unit tests now cover additional edge cases and scenarios.

## Interoperability & Architecture Assessment

The design remains modular and coherent. The integration points have been validated, and the runtime wiring has been confirmed on a deployed-address basis.

## Security & Attack-Surface Critique (High-Level)

### Upgradability / Admin Concentration
- **Risk:** Centralization of upgrade administrators could permit malicious upgrades.
- **Recommendation:** Maintain multisig or governance-controlled ProxyAdmin; conduct tests for upgrade flows.

### Governance Timelock Flows
- **Risk:** Misconfiguration could allow unintended immediate execution.
- **Recommendation:** Continue exhaustive tests for propose/queue/execute, role checks, and delay enforcement.

### Bridge & Cross-Chain Flows
- **Risk:** Potential for relayer compromise and replay/mint duplication.
- **Recommendation:** Implement replay nonces, signature verification, and rate limits.

### ADAM Policy Execution
- **Risk:** Unbounded policy execution affecting state or gas exhaustion.
- **Recommendation:** Conduct unit tests and fuzz tests for gas/time/memory limits; restrict actions through capability checks.

### Reentrancy & External Calls
- **Risk:** Functions that call external contracts might be reentrant.
- **Recommendation:** Apply checks-effects-interactions pattern and use ReentrancyGuard where applicable.

### Math & Accounting
- **Risk:** Potential issues with rounding and edge cases in reward accounting.
- **Recommendation:** Conduct tests with extreme inputs and property/fuzz tests.

## Testing, Static Analysis & CI

The current state shows significant improvements in unit tests, with comprehensive fuzzing and formal tools integrated into CI.

### Recommendations and Priority:
- **Static Analysis:** Continue using Slither, Solhint, MythX (or equivalent).
- **Fuzzing:** Utilize Foundry/Forge or Echidna for invariants.
- **Coverage:** Maintain solidity-coverage to identify untested code paths.
- **CI Gates:** Ensure tests, coverage thresholds, slither scans, and code-formatting/linting are enforced.

## Third-Party Integrations & Dependencies

Observations indicate that third-party interface versions have been locked, and documentation for contract addresses and versions has been updated.

## Contracts Checklist — Critical Testing Targets

- ARCx token: cap enforcement, mint/burn role checks, permit & transfer edge cases.
- ARCs staking: reward math, slashing, rounding, exit/withdraw flows.
- ARCGovernor / ARCTimelock: propose → queue → execute flows; role & delay enforcement; upgrade guardrails.
- Bridge: authorization, nonces/rpc replay, cross-chain relayer model, rate-limits.
- ADAM host/registry: policy sandboxing, resource limits, secure call interfaces.
- Vaults/Auctions: reentrancy, finalization, accounting integrity.

## Remediation Roadmap (Priority Ordered)

1. Validate and finalize static analysis and fuzz tests; address any critical findings. (High)
2. Confirm and lock third-party contract sources and set verified mainnet/testnet addresses. (High)
3. Enforce multisig/governance control for upgrades and timelock admin. (High)
4. Continue to enhance CI gates: tests, coverage, slither. (Medium)
5. Implement on-chain monitoring & incident playbook. (Medium)
6. Conduct legal/compliance review for token sale & data handling. (Low-Medium)

## Mandatory Deliverables

- Updated prioritized, file-by-file test plan for all core contracts.
- Expanded unit & fuzz tests for the core governance contracts.
- Script to validate timelock/role wiring post-deploy.
- Checklist + PR template to lock third-party versions.

# ======================== DEVELOPER REVIEW ===================================

This section provides a prioritized, actionable remediation and improvement plan to harden, test, and upgrade ARC for production. Follow the Immediate → Short → Medium → Long roadmap, run the listed commands, and implement the CI/hooks/tests provided.

---

## High-Level Priorities (in order)

1. **Harden governance & upgradeability**  
2. **Automate security pipeline**  
3. **Expand test coverage**  
4. **Add CI with required gates**  
5. **Improve developer tooling & git hygiene**  
6. **Implement monitoring & incident playbooks**  

---

## Immediate (0–24h) — Apply Now

- Add CI checks to block PRs failing tests/static analysis.
- Add pre-commit hooks to block secrets/formatting fails.
- Add minimal unit tests for critical flows.
- Run static analysis and basic fuzzing locally.

---

## Short Term (1–7 days)

- Add Slither & MythX scans in CI; triage findings.
- Add solidity-coverage; target ≥ 90% coverage for core modules.
- Lock third-party interfaces; vendor exact ABI/commit.

---

## Medium Term (1–4 weeks)

- Formal audit or bounty program for critical modules.
- Replace single-key upgrade/ownership with multisig for ProxyAdmin and Timelock admin.

---

## Long Term (1–3 months)

- Formal verification for core invariants where feasible.
- Comprehensive fuzzing harnesses & continuous fuzzing in CI.

---

## Operational Hardening Checklist (Apply ASAP)

### Governance & Upgrades

- Move ProxyAdmin & timelock admin to Gnosis Safe / multisig.
- Require governance proposals for any proxy upgrade.

### Contracts & Code

- Use OpenZeppelin audited libraries.
- Add modifiers/guards for all externally callable sensitive functions.

### Security & Testing

- Run Slither/static analyzer and triage all medium/high severity items.
- Add fuzzing for token invariants, timelock, and bridge.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Emit structured events for significant actions.
- Add off-chain alerting on those events.

### Developer Workflow

- Document deployment & dry-run steps in README.
