### Immediate Actions After Minting

1. **Secure All Tokens**
    - Store all 1,000,000 ARCx in a secure treasury wallet (hardware or multisig).
    - Do **not** add liquidity or send tokens to exchanges/LPs yet.
    - Wait until allocation and controls are mapped out.

2. **Finalize Tokenomics**
    - Decide allocations for team, treasury, ecosystem, airdrops, incentives, partners, etc.
    - Document the allocation strategy (internal or public).

3. **Define Distribution & Emission Policy**
    - Select between fair launch (airdrop/sale) or controlled launch (treasury governance).
    - Record distribution rules and schedule.

4. **Plan Liquidity Event**
    - Avoid rushing to add liquidity.
    - Prepare a detailed plan:
      - Amount of ARCx and ETH/USDC to pair
      - Target price
      - LP token control (wallet, multisig, contract)
    - Seed liquidity only when ready, with public documentation.

5. **Lock or Vest Team/Ecosystem Tokens (Optional)**
    - Set up vesting/timelocks for team/dev/treasury allocations.
    - Use smart contracts or transparent wallets for trust.

6. **Distribute to Early Adopters (If Planned)**
    - Distribute ARCx to partners, early backers, or participants per the allocation plan.
    - Log all distributions for auditability.

7. **Prepare for DEX Listing**
    - Add initial liquidity to Uniswap (Base) or chosen DEX when ready.
    - Announce pool details to prevent scams/fake pairs.
    - Prepare for volatility.

8. **Mint/Burn Policy**
    - Mint or burn tokens only per protocol rules.
    - Avoid arbitrary supply changes.

### TL;DR — Immediate Steps

- Hold all ARCx in secure treasury.
- Plan allocation and liquidity events.
- Document tokenomics and distribution.
- Distribute tokens carefully (or vest/lock).
- Seed liquidity and open trading only when fully prepared.
