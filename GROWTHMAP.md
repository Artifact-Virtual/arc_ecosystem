# The Growthmap

A direct, actionable plan to strengthen ARCx and Artifact Virtual, focused on security, transparency, and sustainable growth. No marketing fluff—just practical steps.

---

## 1. **Security First**

- **Move ARCx to secure storage:**  
    Transfer all ARCx tokens to a hardware wallet or multisig (if not already).
- **Risk management:**  
    Pause contracts immediately if any risk or uncertainty arises.

---

## 2. **Establish Trust & Proof**

- **Announce official details:**  
    Share ARCx contract address, explorer links, and tokenlist info everywhere.
- **Transparency:**  
    Publish allocation and vesting plans (even basic ones).
- **Documentation:**  
    Update docs and website with only the latest information.

---

## 3. **Fair Distribution Plan**

- **Community allocation:**  
    Decide what % (e.g., 5–10%) to distribute to early supporters or partners.
- **Snapshot eligibility:**  
    Identify early contributors, Discord/Twitter followers, etc.
- **Airdrop tool:**  
    Publish a simple claim/airdrop tool or use trusted services (e.g., Guild.xyz, Layer3).

---

## 4. **Seed Controlled Liquidity**

- **Initial LP creation:**  
    Pair ARCx + ETH (even a small amount) on Uniswap or BaseSwap.
- **Liquidity strategy:**  
    Avoid putting a majority of tokens in LP—just enough for price discovery.
- **Announce LP:**  
    Share LP link with warnings about slippage, risk, and fake tokens.

---

## 5. **Enable Early Utility**

- **Staking & governance:**  
    Enable ARCx staking, governance, or XP rewards for community actions.
- **Perks & access:**  
    Offer ARCx utility in Discord or Artifact Virtual (e.g., early access, voting, exclusive content).

---

## 6. **Explore Revenue Streams**

- **Token sale/presale:**  
    Allocate a % of ARCx for public/private sale at a set ETH/USDC price.
- **Community launchpad:**  
    Run a fair launch (claim page or LBP) and use proceeds for development.
- **Grants & partnerships:**  
    Offer ARCx to strategic partners or for bounties in exchange for support/dev work.

---

## 7. **Track Progress Publicly**

- **Dashboard:**  
    Use a dashboard to mark progress.
- **Transparency:**  
    Publish all major events, allocations, and LP links on website, Discord, or Notion.

---

## 8. **Iterate & Prepare for Next Phases**

- **Bridge/migration:**  
    Start designing bridge/migration processes.
- **Future transitions:**  
    Plan for FUEL transition (snapshots, on-chain records).
- **Audit & optimize:**  
    Audit and optimize all on-chain actions.

---

## **TL;DR: Linear Plan**

1. Secure tokens and treasury  
2. Announce official details  
3. Design distribution/airdrop or sale  
4. Seed minimal liquidity (LP)  
5. Add utility, perks, or staking  
6. *(Optional)* Sell or raise via ARCx  
7. Track and share progress
