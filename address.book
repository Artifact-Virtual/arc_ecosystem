- MEV Delay: 2 seconds (basic anti-sandwich protection)
- Gas Optimized: TRUE (predictable gas usage for all operations)
- Emergency Controls: ENABLED (pause/unpause functionality)
- Architecture: Pure Solidity (no external dependencies for maximum gas predictability)

## Token Distribution Plan (1M Max Supply)
- üè¶ Liquidity Pool: 500,000 ARCx (50%)

## Deployment Commands
```bash
# Mint total supply and setup distribution
npm run setup:distribution

# Deploy vesting contracts
npm run deploy:vesting

# Deploy airdrop system
npm run deploy:airdrop

# Deploy Uniswap V4 with hooks

```

## Security Notes
- All Safe wallets are Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallets
- Deployer wallet should be funded with sufficient ETH for gas
- Private keys are NEVER stored in this repository
- All contract deployments require multi-sig approval for critical functions

## Update Instructions
1. After each deployment, update the corresponding placeholder with the deployed address
2. Update both this file and `scripts/shared/constants.ts`
3. Commit changes immediately to avoid confusion
4. Verify addresses on BaseScan before marking as deployed

# ==========================================================================================
All addresses above are for reference only. No private keys are included.
