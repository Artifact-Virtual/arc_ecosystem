# Deep Audit Report

> Date: 29-08-2025

**Scope:** Focuses on contracts, scripts, integrations, governance, security, tests, and remediation priorities. Excludes environment variable management and secrets handling.

---

## Executive Summary

Top immediate actions: run static analysis + fuzzing, expand tests (governance/timelock/bridge/ADAM), verify third‑party contract sources and addresses, enforce multisig for upgrade/admin roles.
Scope & counts

Contracts inspected: ~54 contract files across modules (DAO/governance, tokens, DeFi, vaults, RWA, pool adapters, third‑party interfaces).
Major modules:
Governance: ARCGovernor, ARCTimelock, ARCProposal, ARCVoting, ARCTreasury, ARCDAO
Policy host: AdamHost, AdamRegistry
Tokens/identity: ARCx, ARCs, Identity SBTs
DeFi/infra: Auctions, StakingVaults, TreasuryRewards, PenaltyVault, Bridge, RWARegistry/Slashing
Pools & third‑party adapters: Uniswap v4 interfaces & adapters
Scripts & tooling: deployment scripts, shared constants, health checks, inspect-tx
Tests: existing unit tests present but limited in scope relative to codebase size (several core tests exist; gaps in bridge/ADAM/edge-case tests).
Interoperability & architecture assessment

Design: modular and coherent. Tokens feed into staking/vaults and governor timelock; ADAM policy layer sits between identity SBTs and governance execution.
Integration points to validate:
Role/permission wiring across Governor ↔ Timelock ↔ Treasury/Proposer/Executor.
Upgradeability (if UUPS/proxy patterns used): who controls upgrade admin and can propose upgrades.
Bridge mint/burn authority and replay protection across chains.
ADAM policy host sandboxing (gas/memory/time/liveness limits).
Overall: pieces are designed to work together, but runtime wiring must be verified on a deployed-address basis.
Security & attack-surface critique (high-level)

Upgradability / admin concentration
Risk: upgrade administrators or timelock admin centralization could permit malicious upgrades.
Recommendation: ensure multisig or governance-controlled ProxyAdmin; tests for upgrade flows.
Governance timelock flows
Risk: proposer/executor misconfiguration could allow unintended immediate execution.
Recommendation: exhaustive tests for propose/queue/execute, role checks, and delay enforcement.
Bridge & cross-chain flows
Risk: relayer compromise, replay/mint duplication, burn authority abuse.
Recommendation: replay nonces, signature verification, rate limits, audit mint authority.
ADAM policy execution
Risk: unbounded policy execution affecting state or gas exhaustion.
Recommendation: unit tests and fuzz tests for gas/time/memory limits; restrict actions through capability checks.
Reentrancy & external calls
Risk: vaults, auctions, or reward distribution functions that call external contracts might be reentrant.
Recommendation: checks-effects-interactions, use ReentrancyGuard where applicable, audit external calls.
Math & accounting
Risk: rounding, reward accounting, stake/unstake edge cases.
Recommendation: tests with extreme inputs and property/fuzz tests.
Testing, static analysis & CI

Current state: limited unit tests; no evident comprehensive fuzzing or formal tools in CI.
Recommendation and priority:
Static analysis: Slither, Solhint, MythX (or equivalent).
Fuzzing: Foundry/Forge or Echidna for invariants (balances, supply cap, replay prevention).
Coverage: solidity-coverage to find untested code paths.
Add CI gates: tests, coverage threshold, slither scan, and code-formatting/linting.
Example commands (run in repo root):
npx hardhat compile && npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
docker run --rm -v %cd%:/src trailofbits/slither slither /src
Third‑party integrations & dependencies

Observations:
Uniswap v4 adapter sources appear incomplete/placeholder; POSITION_DESCRIPTOR_ADDR is a 0x0 placeholder in env.
External service integrations (Pinata, WalletConnect, OKX, etc.) exist in scripts/config and must be validated for correct usage and secrets management (you indicated .env.example exists).
Recommendation:
Vendor/lock third‑party interface versions; document exact contract addresses and versions used.
Replace placeholders with verified addresses post-deploy and add runtime checks in deployment scripts.
Contracts checklist — critical testing targets

ARCx token: cap enforcement, mint/burn role checks, permit & transfer edge cases.
ARCs staking: reward math, slashing, rounding, exit/withdraw flows.
ARCGovernor / ARCTimelock: propose → queue → execute flows; role & delay enforcement; upgrade guardrails.
Bridge: authorization, nonces/rpc replay, cross‑chain relayer model, rate‑limits.
ADAM host/registry: policy sandboxing, resource limits, secure call interfaces.
Vaults/Auctions: reentrancy, finalization, accounting integrity.
Remediation roadmap (priority ordered)

Run full static analysis and fuzz tests; fix critical findings. (High)
Expand unit/integration tests for timelock/governor/bridge/ADAM/vaults. (High)
Confirm & lock third‑party contract sources and set verified mainnet/testnet addresses not placeholders. (High)
Enforce multisig/governance control for upgrades and timelock admin. (High)
Add CI gates: tests, coverage, slither. (Medium)
Add on-chain monitoring & incident playbook (alerts for large transfers, upgrades). (Medium)
Legal/compliance review for token sale & data handling (Pinata/IPFS). (Low‑Medium)
Practical verification commands (Windows PowerShell)

Compile & run tests:

cd L:\worxpace\arc_ecosystemnpm cinpx hardhat compilenpx hardhat testnpx hardhat coverage
Static analysis (Docker recommended):

docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/src trailofbits/slither slither /src
Foundry fuzz tests (if available in repo):

foundryupforge test


# Mandatory Deliverables

- Prioritized, file-by-file test plan (concrete test cases) for all core contracts.
- Sample unit & fuzz tests for the 6 core governance contracts (propose/queue/execute/upgrade).
- Script to validate timelock/role wiring post‑deploy (status & assertions).
- Checklist + PR template to lock third‑party versions and replace placeholders post-deploy.
