Dear [Auditor],

Please find our ARCx Token repo at [https://github.com/Artifact-Virtual/arcx_token)].

Main contract: ARCxToken.sol (OpenZeppelin-based, role-based, capped, pausable, bridge logic)
Deployment: deploy_arcx.ts
Tests: ARCx.test.ts
Config: hardhat.config.ts
Docs: README.md, WHITEPAPER.md, security-report.md
The contract is not upgradeable, uses OpenZeppelin for security, and includes emergency pause and mint finalization.
Please focus on role management, minting/bridge logic, and any edge cases in ERC20 behavior.

Let me know if you need further details or access.

Best,
[Your Name]
