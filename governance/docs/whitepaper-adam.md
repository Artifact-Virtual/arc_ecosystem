## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Mission Statement

The ADAM Protocol implements Constitutional Intelligence - a deterministic, auditable governance framework that binds capital, reputation, and verifiable real-world impact into a unified decision-making system. Unlike traditional DAOs that rely on simple token-weighted voting or informal social consensus, ADAM Protocol creates a machine-enforceable constitution where every rule is implemented without ambiguity.

### 1.2 Core Innovation

**Multi-Dimensional Voting Power**: Voting weight is calculated from three distinct but complementary sources:
- **Capital Commitment**: ARCx token stake with duration multipliers
- **Reputation Authority**: Soulbound tokens proving specialized expertise
- **Real-World Impact**: Attestations of verifiable off-chain contributions

**Context-Aware Governance**: Different proposal types activate different voter constituencies, ensuring domain expertise drives relevant decisions while maintaining democratic oversight.

### 1.3 Key Differentiators

1. **Formalist Design Philosophy**: Every governance rule is implementable in smart contract code
2. **Anti-Plutocracy Mechanisms**: Quadratic voting and component caps prevent whale dominance
3. **RWA-Native Architecture**: Real-world assets are first-class participants in governance
4. **Cryptographic Privacy**: MACI integration ensures secret balloting and anti-collusion
5. **Emergency Safeguards**: Bytecode-limited emergency powers with dual-quorum requirements

### 2.2 Actor Model

**Primary Actors**:
- **Voters**: Hold ARCx, SBTs, and/or RWA attestations
- **Proposers**: Submit governance proposals with required bonds
- **Oracle Operators**: Attest to real-world asset states
- **Emergency Council**: Limited emergency pause/cancel powers
- **MACI Coordinator**: Operates anti-collusion voting infrastructure

**Secondary Actors**:
- **Validators**: Verify RWA attestations and oracle data
- **Challengers**: Dispute fraudulent attestations or oracle updates
- **Delegates**: Receive voting power delegation per component type

### 2.3 Data Flow

1. **Proposal Submission**: Proposers submit typed proposals with bonds
2. **Eligibility Determination**: Engine calculates voter eligibility per topic
3. **Weight Calculation**: Aggregator computes multi-component voting power
4. **Secret Voting**: MACI enables private ballot casting with ZK proofs
5. **Execution**: Passed proposals execute through timelock and modular executors
6. **Monitoring**: All actions emit events for transparency and analysis

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 ARCx Token System

The ARCx token serves as the foundational governance asset with enhanced staking mechanics:

#### Token Mechanics
- **Total Supply**: Fixed at 100,000,000 ARCx
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Standard**: ERC-20 with ERC-20Votes extension
- **Staking**: Lock mechanism with duration multipliers
- **Slashing**: Optional for high-privilege roles

#### Staking Formula
```
stake_weight = min(1 + log(1 + stake_days / 30), 2.5) * stake_amount
voting_power = floor(sqrt(stake_weight)) * slashing_risk_factor
```

Where:
- `stake_days`: Duration of token lock in days
- `slashing_risk_factor`: 0.5-1.2 based on role exposure
- Maximum multiplier caps prevent excessive concentration

### 3.2 Soulbound Token (SBT) System

Soulbound tokens represent non-transferable credentials proving specialized expertise and contribution history.

#### SBT Categories
1. **Technical Contributor**: Code commits, audits, infrastructure
2. **Governance Participant**: Proposal quality, voting consistency
3. **RWA Curator**: Real-world asset verification and management
4. **Community Leader**: Moderation, education, onboarding
5. **Oracle Operator**: Data feed reliability and accuracy

#### Activity Decay Model
```
activity_weight = base_weight * exp(-(time_since_last_contribution / decay_constant))
```

- **Decay Constant**: 90 days default
- **Minimum Floor**: 25% of base weight retained
- **Refresh Mechanism**: On-chain contributions reset decay timer

### 3.3 Real-World Asset (RWA) Integration

RWA attestations provide governance weight based on verified real-world impact and contributions.

#### Supported RWA Types
1. **Energy Assets**: Solar, wind, battery storage installations
2. **Carbon Credits**: Verified emission reductions and offsets
3. **Data Feeds**: High-quality oracle data provision
4. **Infrastructure**: Physical network infrastructure deployment
5. **Liquidity Provision**: DEX liquidity and market making

#### Attestation Process
1. **Oracle Submission**: 2-of-N oracle operators sign attestation
2. **EAS Recording**: Ethereum Attestation Service stores proof
3. **Impact Calculation**: Quantity, quality, and recency weighting
4. **Challenge Period**: 72-hour window for dispute submission
5. **Weight Activation**: Confirmed attestations add to voting power

---

## 4. Voting Weight Mathematics

### 4.1 Canonical Weight Formula

For voter `v` on proposal `p` with topic `τ`:

```
W(v,p) = α·f_token(v,p) + β·f_identity(v,p) + Σ_k γ_k(τ)·f_rwa,k(v,p)
```

### 4.2 Component Calculations

#### Token Component
```
f_token = QV(sqrt(stake_weight)) * slashing_risk_factor
stake_weight = min(1 + log(1 + stake_days/30), 2.5) * stake_amount
QV(x) = min(floor(sqrt(x)), 100)
```

#### Identity Component  
```
f_identity = Σ_i role_weight_i * activity_decay(Δt_i)
activity_decay(Δt) = max(0.25, exp(-Δt / 90_days))
```

#### RWA Components
```
f_rwa,k = impact_score_k * recency_decay_k(Δt) * stake_lock_factor_k
recency_decay_k(Δt) = exp(-Δt / recency_window_k)
stake_lock_factor_k ∈ [0.5, 1.2]
```

### 4.3 Weight Normalization

```
W_normalized = min(W_raw, W_max)
component_cap_check: each component ≤ 0.6 * W_normalized
```

### 4.4 Default Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| α (token weight) | 0.5 | Token component multiplier |
| β (identity weight) | 0.2 | SBT component multiplier |
| γ_energy | 0.2 | Energy RWA multiplier |
| γ_carbon | 0.1 | Carbon RWA multiplier |
| W_max | 10,000 | Maximum total voting power |
| Component cap | 0.6 | Maximum single component share |
| QV cap | 100 | Quadratic voting ceiling |

## 6. Security Framework

### 6.1 Attack Vector Analysis

#### Plutocracy Prevention
- **Quadratic Voting**: √(stake) reduces large holder advantage
- **Component Caps**: No single component >60% of voting power
- **Multi-Asset Requirements**: Diverse asset types required for major decisions

#### Sybil Resistance  
- **SBT Verification**: Identity tokens require proof of contribution
- **Activity Monitoring**: Decay functions reduce inactive credential value
- **Cross-Reference Checks**: Multiple attestation sources required

#### Collusion Mitigation
- **MACI Integration**: Secret ballot prevents vote buying verification
- **Per-Proposal Salts**: Unique identifiers prevent vote replay
- **Delegation Limits**: Component-specific delegation prevents consolidation

### 6.2 Oracle Security Model

#### Multi-Signature Requirements
- **2-of-N Threshold**: Minimum two oracle signatures for attestations
- **Stake Requirements**: Operators post significant collateral
- **Slash Conditions**: Proven fraud results in stake loss

#### Dispute Resolution Process
1. **Challenge Submission**: Bonded challenge with evidence
2. **Evidence Review**: Public review period with counter-evidence
3. **Adjudication**: Automated or community resolution
4. **Outcome Execution**: Slash fraudulent operators, return bonds

### 6.3 Emergency Procedures

#### Emergency Council Powers (Bytecode Limited)
- **Pause Protocol**: Halt new proposals and voting
- **Cancel Proposals**: Stop pre-execution proposals only
- **No Treasury Access**: Cannot move funds or change parameters

#### Dual-Quorum Requirement
- **Token Quorum**: 4% of total token supply
- **SBT Quorum**: 20% of active SBT holders
- **Time Window**: Both quorums must be achieved within 6 hours

### 6.4 Upgradeability Controls

#### Governance-Controlled Upgrades
- **Proxy Patterns**: OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts
- **Timelock Requirements**: All upgrades through governance timelock
