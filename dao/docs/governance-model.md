# ARCx Governance Model — Next-Gen Constitutional DAO

## 1. Multi-Dimensional Voting Rights

**Composable Governance Layers:**

- **ARCx Token:** Base economic weight, staked for security, liquidity, and treasury alignment. Longer staking duration and slashing risk increase voting power, incentivizing long-term alignment.
- **ARCx-Identity SBTs:** Soulbound, non-transferable credentials for unique, verifiable contributions (code, governance, RWA onboarding, validator ops). SBTs are upgradable and expire if inactivity is detected, ensuring active participation.
- **ARCx Proof Assets:** Tokenized attestations from RWAs (e.g., carbon credits, liquidity receipts, data feeds). Each asset is cryptographically linked to on-chain oracles and off-chain proofs, providing dynamic, context-aware voting weight.

**Synergistic Bundles:**  
Voters hold a portfolio of capital, reputation, and RWA proofs. A dynamic scoring engine balances these, preventing plutocracy or reputation monopolies. All weights are transparent, auditable, and recalculated per proposal.

## 2. Adaptive Voting Mechanisms

**Quadratic, Contextual, and Modular:**

- **Quadratic Voting:** Diminishing returns on ARCx token weight, Sybil-resistant via ZK proofs and SBT gating.
- **Identity SBTs:** 1-person-1-vote on reputation-based proposals. SBTs can be revoked for inactivity or malicious behavior.
- **Proof Asset Multipliers:** Only relevant RWA holders can vote on domain-specific proposals (e.g., energy, carbon, liquidity). Multipliers are algorithmically adjusted based on asset impact and recency.

**Dynamic Ballot Segmentation:**

- Proposals are auto-categorized (Treasury, Protocol, RWA, Grants, etc.).
- Only eligible voters (by asset, SBT, or stake) are activated per proposal.
- Cross-domain proposals require multi-layer consensus (e.g., Treasury + RWA).

## 3. Autonomous Execution Layer

**On-Chain Constitutional Engine:**

- **Proposal Outcomes:** Directly trigger smart contract modules (upgrade, fund, parameterize, pause).
- **Composable Modules:** Each proposal type maps to a modular, upgradable contract function.
- **Fallback Council:** Multi-sig council is emergency-only, with transparent, time-locked override.

**Temporal & Challenge Locks:**

- All major changes have programmable delays (7–14 days), with on-chain challenge windows.
- Emergency actions (pause, freeze) require dual-quorum: token + SBT.

## 4. Deep RWA Integration

**Programmable Attestations:**

- **RWA Tokens:** Carbon credits, energy receipts, bonds, datasets, patents—each with on-chain attestation and oracle verification.
- **Staking & Slashing:** RWA tokens staked into the DAO; slashing for fraudulent claims.
- **Governance Weight:** RWA stakers earn proposal-specific voting rights and rewards, proportional to real-world impact.

**Utility Feedback Loops:**

- DAO investments in RWAs (e.g., solar farms) grant governance power to relevant RWA token holders.
- Real-world performance (e.g., energy output, carbon offset) feeds back into governance weight via oracles.

---

## 5. DAO Process Automation

**Proposal Submission:**

- Requires ARCx stake + optional SBT.
- On-chain spam/malicious detection with auto-slashing and reputation downgrade.

**Deliberation:**

- Off-chain discussion (forum, Discord) auto-summarized with AI, logged to IPFS/Arweave.
- On-chain metadata links to deliberation history.

**Voting:**

- Live calculation of weights (ARCx, SBT, RWA) with ZK privacy and Sybil resistance.
- Voters can delegate by layer (capital, reputation, RWA).

**Execution:**

- Autonomous execution via constitutional engine.
- Rollback/override only via time-locked, multi-sig emergency path.

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

1. **Identity SBT Contract:** Issue to contributors, with upgradable and revocable logic.
2. **RWA Attestation Framework:** Integrate oracles and off-chain proofs for first RWA type (e.g., carbon credits).
3. **Voting Module:** Fork Snapshot/Tally, extend with multi-layer, context-aware logic and ZK proofs.
4. **Constitutional Engine:** Modular, upgradable smart contracts for proposal execution.
5. **DAO Treasury:** ARCx Safe governed by this model, with programmable RWA staking and rewards.
6. **AI-Powered Deliberation:** Integrate AI summarization and on-chain logging for transparent governance history.

## 8. System Architecture & Operational Flow (At a Glance)

### 1) System Architecture

- **Inputs:**  
    - ARCx stake (economic alignment)
    - Identity SBT (soulbound, reputation)
    - RWA attestations (energy, carbon, data, LP receipts)

- **Weighting/Eligibility Engine:**  
    - Context-gated weighting:  
        `W = α·f_token + β·f_id + Σ γ_k(topic)·f_rwa,k`
    - MACI/Semaphore for anti-collusion and Sybil resistance

- **Governance Process:**  
    - Proposal Registry (IPFS/EAS) → Deliberation → Voting Module → Timelock → Executor (Gnosis Safe + Modules)

- **Modules:**  
    - Treasury Allocator
    - Parameter Manager
    - RWA Onboarder
    - Grants
    - Emergency Brake

- **Monitoring:**  
    - On-chain events → subgraph → transparency dashboards

### 2) Proposal → Vote → Execute Flow

- Submit (stake + credential) → register → discuss → context gate → compute weights → MACI/Semaphore tally → thresholds → timelock → Safe executor → emit events

### 3) Lifecycle State Machine

- Draft → Submitted → Review → Voting → (Passed | Failed)
- If Passed → Timelock → Execute → Monitor (with emergency veto path back to Draft for rework)

### 4) Governance Config (JSON)

- Set α/β/γ weights, quadratic cap, minimum stake, SBT requirements, topic-scoped RWA multipliers
- Topic categories with distinct quorum, supermajority, eligibility sets, timelocks, emergency cancel settings
- MACI parameters (coordinator, voice credits)
- Executor Safe + module addresses (placeholders ready to wire)

### Assessment & Recommendations

**Strengths:**
- The architecture is modular, context-aware, and leverages best-in-class anti-collusion and Sybil resistance (MACI/Semaphore).
- Clear separation of concerns: input weighting, proposal lifecycle, execution, and monitoring.
- Flexible governance config enables rapid adaptation and topic-specific tuning.
- Emergency and veto paths provide resilience and safety.

**Considerations for Bulletproofing:**
- **Attack Surface:**  
    - Ensure all weighting logic and eligibility checks are fully auditable and resistant to manipulation (especially with RWA attestations and SBT revocation).
    - Regular audits of MACI/Semaphore integration and fallback council logic.

- **Edge Cases:**  
    - Define clear procedures for proposal rework, emergency veto, and dispute resolution.
    - Stress-test timelock and emergency brake mechanisms for liveness and censorship resistance.

- **Transparency & Monitoring:**  
    - Expand on-chain/off-chain monitoring to include anomaly detection and automated alerts for governance attacks or inactivity.

- **Upgradability:**  
    - Ensure all modules (especially the constitutional engine and executor) are upgradable with robust governance and rollback paths.

- **User Experience:**  
    - Streamline proposal submission and deliberation UX, with clear eligibility feedback and transparent weight computation.

**Conclusion:**  
The proposed system is robust and future-proof, aligning with the advanced governance model described above. With rigorous testing, regular audits, and continuous monitoring, it can achieve bulletproof security and adaptability. Ongoing review cycles and community feedback will be essential to maintain resilience as the DAO and its RWA integrations scale.
